            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I wanna show you how to make properly hard cooked eggs and ouf mole, that is a softer one. The first thing that you do in the round part of the egg, you make a little hole because there is the air chamber. That relieves the pressure. Very often, you put that in boiling water, the egg will crack. That will relieve the pressure. So that you can see it, I'm gonna stop the boiling here and show it to you. You will see that when I put that in there, the pressure will be released because of that. So here we go here. You can see it going down. And the second one here again. I'm putting the heat back on. I don't really want it to boil very strongly. Very, very gentle boil. If it boils too fast, it toughens the albumin, the egg white will be tough. We're gonna put that on, ten ten minutes for the large eggs, ten minutes, and seven minutes for the egg marlin. When you put the eggs into the boiling water, the sulfur in the eggs, you know what smell, the smell of rotten eggs, it get away from the heat. It goes toward the center of the egg. And there is a reaction with the yolk, the iron in the yolk, and it creates that blue tinge that you have around your yolk and that trunk's made of sulfur. So what we'll have to do, as soon as the egg is cooked, we take it out, put it into ice cold water. Then the sulfur, fill the cold, cross the egg white, and dissipate in the water. So you have an egg without any, you know, any of that green tinge around the yolk, and very nice and tender. Okay. I removed this one at seven minutes, this one ten minutes. Ice cold water, and let it cool in there. And now for the poached eggs, you do in water with a little bit of vinegar on top. The vinegar, of course, prevents the egg white from spreading out too much. We used to break ten eggs in a row when I was in the apprenticeship, but if you do one or two eggs, maybe it's good to break one directly in there, and then place it into barely boiling water like this. Okay. So the eggs. Usually, it will come a little bit to the surface. You help maybe with a slotted spoon like that when it start going up. And of course, it goes between four, five minutes, six minutes, depending on how you like your eggs. It's important also for the eggs, you have your eggs cold. Rather, if it's at room temperature, the egg white tend to spread out more. And here, as I said, you can pull it out gently like this, just by running it. That make it move. That's it. Every couple minutes, you can lift it up and test it, see the way you like it, usually about five minutes. This is the hard cooked eggs. You want to eat it with a spoon like that. It goes into the ice water. And frankly, the best way of pilling it under running water. Under the shell, you have a skin. You have to break through that skin, and running water in the same guander and in mixinity. Yeah, the egg itself now. And then again, you would put that into water and ice. That's to cool off your egg and also to wash a bit of the vinegar. In a professional kitchen, you will post two dozen eggs this way. Now usually, your post egg, you trim some of the hanging white like this. You look at it, there is one side well, look a bit better than the other side. That's how you present it, either this way or this way. And then you keep them in cold water. When someone has an order, you grab that egg, lower it into hot water for twenty, thirty seconds and serve it. This is our egg mole, which basically in another way of doing a poached egg. I very often do it this way rather than this same texture. And this is the hard cooked eggs that I have here. You can see that the hard cooked eggs will cut right through, and the yolk will be absolutely beautiful. No green tinge around the yolk, no smell of sulfur. For me, going to a restaurant and having a perfectly cooked, hard cooked egg is an indication of knowledge in the kitchen. This is the egg mole, which is about seven minutes, six and a half, seven minutes. And as you can see, it's basically like a poached egg, sometimes easier to do than the poached egg. And then finally, the poached egg here, Again, the texture will be about the same here. Poached eggs, half mole, an hard cooked egg. There is another egg that I've done here cooked at low temperature. Usually, people do it when you cook sous vide with a circulator or an agitator where the water is mixed. It's cooked at one hundred and fifty degree, you know, much lower than the two twelve, which is boiling water. And it's cooked for I cook this one for one hour. And as you see, it comes out. You don't shell it. It comes out this way. The texture of the yolk is almost like the same texture of the yolk and the white together. Different egg, quite moist and a different texture than those. So there are four different ways of cooking your egg. You know, I love to do that with the kid. I have two eggs here. Which one is hard cook. This one is raw. One is raw, one is hard cook. And what you do, you spin the egg. Like this one here, basically doesn't spin. This is the raw egg. This one here, it goes so much that it stands up like this because it's totally solid. So so, you know, the kid loves to do that. So whoop. Again, Here is the hard cooked eggs, and here is the raw eggs. And the more it cooked, if it's halfway cooked, it will spin more and more and more and more, eventually standing up like this. Happy cooking."

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I love to do fritters. Apple fritter, vegetable fritter, you name it, even meat leftover too. I'll show you a very easy one here. Half a cup of flour pan like, you know, a quarter of a teaspoon of baking powder and sparkling water. In that case, I'm taking, you know, any sparkling water like this. The same amount than the flour. I put about half of it in there. Mix it a little more. Mix it. Now the rest of it. Actually, you see how how thin it is. Could be a bit thinner than that, so a little more sparkling water. That in that case, we're going to do corn. And I have frozen corn here. Put them directly in there, but you could do apple. You know, to slice or dice apple in there, and that's it. You would do this. You mix it in there. I have oil here. Oil should be hot. And, you know, you can use vegetable oil or olive oil. About here a quarter of a cup here, as you can see. I will do with that half a cup of flour, you know, quite a lot of those. I have a large skillet here. Okay. That fry beautifully. You can see the edge now, which are getting crunchy. So that will take, I would say, a good three minute on on each side. You can see the bubble on top here and the side, and I can see that it's brown. I would say it was at least four minutes. Sometimes they glue together a little bit, so separate them like this. Okay. When they're nice and crisp, always better to do them at the last moment, frankly. But if you do them ahead, you can read them in the oven. Make sure that when you do them ahead, you put them on a wire rack like that there. It's in this steak, people do very often. When they fry something and there is fat, they put it on a plate with a paper towel to absorb. Well, what happened, the whole bottom gets soggy. I learned that from the Koreans. South Koreans does a lot of frying. Like that on a wire rack so the hair goes underneath so it doesn't get soggy underneath. Probably a dash of salt on top of that, and it's a great garnish with meat, fish, to order by itself. Terrific. So it's about now you can see most of the oil most of it has been absorbed, and I would say that I had about, yeah, proof of charcoal. Let's see the other side. You see it brown. Doesn't brown exactly the same way than on the top, the set, but when you see the the tiny hole around, that indicate that it's it's going to be very crispy. So here it goes on this. And as you can see here, half a cup of flour, a cup of the corn and, half a cup of, a little more than about two third of a cup of water, and that's what I add here. I'm dying to taste it, but, it's sad. Nice and crispy. I forgot the sauce. I even put salt on top. You could put a bit of salt in the batter too. And this is it. Happy cooking."

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I I always cook turkey for Thanksgiving. For me, it is the best tradition. Actually, Thanksgiving is the best holiday of all for me. It is not a holiday because of some date of a battle fighting somewhere or some type of religious holiday. No. It is holiday To get together, to eat, to drink, to be merry, to be with your friends. So this is the greatest holiday. I have a twelve, About twelve pound turkey here. Usually I do it not bigger than that, even smaller. And what I do first, I'm going to remove the wishbone here. It's a little hard to see, but on each side here, you can feel it with your finger. There's like a A triangle here of this, and I have to continue cutting it a little higher. Trying to pry it with your finger, index finger, and all that. That's it. And you get that thing now, that big triangle here out. As you can see, it broke, but I have that triangle here. And that triangle here, which is here, when you have it inside there, It give you a hard time to carve. So even the chicken and all that, I remove the wishbone here. I have a quart of water here. I'm going to put that in there And I'm going to start my sauce with it. Another thing that I do, I will cut the end of that drumstick here. Okay. That goes in there too. The other one I did. What happened is that when this is cooked, it's going to shrink. And as you can see, you can see those tendon sticking out. When those tendon comes out easily, your turkey is cooked. In addition, you remove all those tendon, which is makes it easier To eat, I have the neck here, again, in a glass of water. And in there, I have, Of course, the gizzard, which will go also in there for my sauce, and the liver. That liver is small, I have a that liver, usually I keep it here, and later on, when I'm preparing, I saute that briefly and I enjoy that with a glass of wine. This is the, you know, special bonus for the chef. Another thing that I do, I feel that in the middle of the leg, it's always the place there where it doesn't Cooked enough. So I do a little incision here like this because it always stay a little red in the articulation here. So I do a little incision that help. And actually, the same thing here that I can do, Cutting the articulation of the wing a little bit. Just starting like this, that help the heat goes into it, And it doesn't stay red there. Then salt, all of the the place inside, Pepper. Inside two. All right. And I want to cook. May turkey this way. Breast side up to start. So I will start with, oh, maybe A teaspoon of oil on top, just enough to start the browning a little bit. And that will go into the oven, for like forty five minutes at least at four hundred degree. Now we continue with I have the neck here, the gizzard, the end of the thing. This is the start of the juice, the natural juice that we're going to do with the turkey. So I have that in there. I have no salt. What I'm going to put in there is probably a good teaspoon Or maybe two teaspoon of, soy to replace the salt to get a nice color to my brown stock. Eventually, this is going to be Diglazing the pan over there. But for the time being, I want to bring that to a boil, cook that for one hour. After an hour, we can pick the meat Of the neck and so forth and continue with the sauce. Next is the dressing. I have onion, Corn, mushroom, and two cups of, of chicken stock here. As you can see, those mushrooms are a little dark, and it's okay. They'll have more taste even. So I'm going to put this one cup Of corn, four tablespoons of butter, one cup of onion, And a good cup of mushroom too. I'm gonna put that in the microwave oven for like a minute, couple of minutes to Cook them a little bit, and then I will go on with this here. Often, I buy a whole corn. I love cornbread and so Also, this is a cornbread stuffing here, but my wife happened to like that one here. So this is a cornbread stuffing all seasoned already. So as you can see, I have my mixture here, and that goes into one of those package, which is about three quarter of a pound. Okay. This, of course, you can do that ahead. You can stuff the turkey with that. I think it's easier to do it separate. So let's see what we have in there. Okay. My dressing is ready here. Cover it. And that goes into the oven for thirty, thirty five minutes. I put all of the temperature at four hundred degrees, so that's fine. So that turkey has been forty five minutes here. And what I'm going to do is to turn it upside down. So now I wanna cook it breast side down so it doesn't dry out. Cook it like this, and that will cook like that for one hour, Same temperature. Of course, the bonus for the chef, a little piece of butter. I have to give some to my wife today, otherwise. Salt, pepper, And, and that's it. I really add a small liver here. Usually it's Quite larger than that, but it's fine. Saute it. The liver should always be slightly pink inside. Otherwise, if it cooked too much, then it get really, Pasty and, rubbery like. So yes, like any type of liver. So you saute that briefly. Okay. Minute, about a minute. Minutes, minutes and a half on one side, the other side. Okay. Here I have the special treat for the chef, Just pink inside as you can see that. Special bonus when you're cooking. Bon appetit. Now my sauce, The juice rather, that is the water with the neck and all that, that's cooked for an hour and a quarter. I drain it, as you can see, And I add more water, and make sure that you have two and a half cups. I need two and a half cup of sauce. And as you see, I have a nice Color because of the soy sauce. So here I have the gizzard, you know, that I'm going to cut into pieces. And I'm going to put all of that in there. And also in there, I'm putting threefour of a cup Of chopped onion, three quarter of a cup of chopped of carrot, diced carrot, rather. This will go in the bottom of my pan Finish the sauce later on. But this, this, and that is going to go back, cooked a little longer, And I'm going to thicken it. So here is the gazette. Now the neck. I will pick up as much meat And I run from around the neck. This is a really good meat. In fact, very often, when I don't do that, when I Put the neck right around the turkey to, to roast in it. And there is already between A fight between my daughter and my wife who is going to get the neck. Okay. But this is good meat, so take your time to remove as much as we can Out of it. So my mixture has been cooking for a few minutes here. Remember, I have the water that I cooked the neck, the gizzard, all that. I have carrot, onion, all the meat that I picked up too. I wanna taste it for, more salt there. Well, we need salt. Now I can put a bit more soy or a bit of salt or both. Depends the way you want it. Yeah. Like that. It'd be Slightly darker. That's good. And I will thicken that with a little bit of potato starch. One teaspoon here. Maybe two teaspoons. Any pure starch, Whether you use arrowroot, arrowroot is very expensive, or cornstarch, I like potato starch, it's inexpensive, works well, tapioca starch and so forth has to be diluted with liquid. So here I put a dash of white wine. Let's say two, two tablespoons or so. Doesn't really matter. And then you stir it. We dilute. And as you put it in there, it will thicken on contact. Now I put a little bit and I stir it. Put a little bit and I stir it. Put up the rest of it too. Here, I'll put the rest of it too. And as you can see now, it's slightly, slightly oily, like a beautiful juice. And this is what will go in the bottom of my pan when I finish cooking the turkey. Okay, now my turkey has been cooking Breast side down for a good hour. So I'm gonna turn it back up again. Here. Now I know it's really moist. So then I put it back in the oven for another twenty, thirty minutes to really brown the top beautifully. So this is it. My turkey is done now. And you can see, for example, here, if I go take a little bit of the sinew, That, I take those sinew out here. Oh, there. So those are long finue here that you can clean up Like this. Hello. Now I will put my turkey Here. Let it rest In a warm place, you know. And then here, as you can see, we have all the beautiful crystallization of the juice Because I have a good pan, thick heavy aluminum or copper, if you do that in a stainless steel pan like that, it burns. So there's crystallized juice we call glaze, and the process of deglazing is to add liquid to those glaze. Usually, you would use a flat food spatula to melt all of that stuff. For that set here, I think that I really cleaned up my pan Prove only here. And that's it. As you can see here, I have a clean pan. I melt all those crystallized juice. That's what make the sauce. So here is My final sauce here. I want to taste it. I think it's just about perfect. Maybe a dash of salt. Remember that I only put a bit of soy sauce, No salt. I'm ready with the stuffing here, dressing. Now this is it. Usually I would serve that in the kitchen, but you can bring it directly in the dining room. The first thing you want to do is to separate That big leg here. As you can see, you break it at the joint, it will break. And then at the joint after, you can separate it, the drumstick, A drumstick on that. And again, as I explained before, the drumstick, you're gonna cut it into pieces like this. See, separate now, totally cooked. And Some of those sinews here should have come out. And now The thigh here, the thigh, I'm gonna cut it into pieces along the bone. Remember, this is for ten, twelve people. This is the leg on each side that I will do this way. For the breast, Remember, I will cut it here. My wife is going to have that part. And here, we start cutting down as because I cut here. So that gives me a cutting point here. And I keep cutting. That's it. I may bring that back against it. If I cut it on each side this way, I'll be the sauce for color on top of it here. And that's how I would serve it, but often I will serve it individually Like this. A dressing here. I will put a good portion here. A little piece of the dark meat. Dark meat is always my favorite here. And of course, a nice piece of the breast. It is hot here. Nice piece of the breast served here. And of course, without forgetting, The sauce, which is going to go all around, and here it is. My Thanksgiving turkey, Well, for any holiday. I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you, and happy cooking."

A couple of tablespoon of apricot here, preserve. And I have about three quarter of a cup of orange juice, all stuff that I have in my refrigerator, and I will mix that together.

        "transcription": [
            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. New England clam chowder is on the menu today. I used to do this when I worked for Howard Johnson in three thousand gallon batch. Not exactly like this, but, I will show you how to do it. I have some bacon here, a couple of slices of bacon, two or three slices. I should have about probably, Probably half a cup. Yeah. About half a cup of bacon here with a little bit of olive oil. Easy one one tablespoon of olive oil. I want that to fry for a few minutes, three, four minutes. And then after, we're gonna put leek in it. I have one leek here. Cut it in half. I put you through to expose the center of the leek. That's where the dirt is. So we wash it. Okay. That's Probably two cups of leek here. I like leek. You can put onion. If you don't have leek, it's okay. On top of the leek, I'm going to put some garlic. And usually, I crush the garlic and peel it fine, but you can also do it with this. As you can see, to do garlic this way, You can see here the amount of garlic. You can even do it the other way if you wanna see the inside. And here I will have have a large load of garlic, probably a good two teaspoon of garlic here. Can, of course, crush it by hand as I do usually, but there's another way of doing it. But I think my Bacon is about fine now. So leek goes in it. Garlic. And I wanna cook that for a minute or so Together, I'll put a little bit of fresh thyme in it I am from my garden, so like a teaspoon. And jalapeno pepper. Always test your jalapeno pepper when you do it because sometimes I use those and Tell about the taste of green pepper. Some of the time, it kind of blow your mind. This will have a bit of a kick, not too much. So you can adjust The quantity that you want to put in there. Maybe I'm putting the whole thing here, which is probably like two, three tablespoons. This again, I stir it. I'm going to put Two cups here of clam juice, and, probably a cup of water. And I have about half a pound of potato here, two potatoes. I'm gonna cut them into dice, about half inch. About the same amount that I have of leek. So this is the New England clam chowder. I used to have a restaurant in New York called La Potagerie on Fifth Avenue. I used to do the Manhattan clam chowder with vegetable, you know, tomato, vegetable, and all that. Quite different. That's the classic New England. So again, about two cups of potato. Okay. Here, you're going to have eventually to adjust For salt, of course, so I have about probably a good half a teaspoon of salt and pepper. When I do a lot of cooking, I know I want to use freshly freshly ground pepper, so if I do a lot, so I know I need so I use that type of little coffee grinder, you know, to do fresh pepper. That's it. So this, pretty strong. So I have freshly ground pepper here, and I put probably Half a teaspoon or so in there. This is it. And One thing that I forgot to do was to put flour. I was going to put some flour right on top of the leek. When you wanna take liquid out of a a bowl like this, very often what you do is to go directly into your stock like this and grab liquid, you see. This is a bit okay. I will dilute a couple of tablespoons of flour in it. Remember, when I did the leek, I could have done directly into the leek, sprinkle it on top, and that would have been easy to do. But here, that's another way of doing it. You don't wanna put the flour right in there here because it probably would forming to lumps. This now will come to a boil. Boil gently for, like, about twenty minutes. And some corn. I put a bit of corn in my chowder because I like corn, and I think it goes well with it. So when you cut corn like that fresh, Be sure your finger on the higher end of the corn. It goes here, and you pivot it. When you cut it with the knife, don't put your knife straight like this. It's hard. You have to cut. You see, it's easy to cut like this. You know, the motion of a knife, that is The motion of cutting rather than just crushing. You can do it, of course, Another way by, by putting this straight down and doing it the other way. Those are fresh Corn, and there is nothing like and one corn like this, yeah, will give you a cup, about a cup of corn. So we'll put that at the end because I don't want to cook the corn more than, like, one minute. Just bring them to a boil at the end with the cream. You can see the texture that it has here. It's just slightly oily. I will test it for salt. I think it's fine now. Cover this, Lower the heat, twenty minutes. Okay, my chowder is nice and thick here, the way I want it. So now I'm putting my corn in there, and I just want that to come to a boil with the clam. I add two can of Ten ounce inch of baby clam here cooked. Of course, you can do that with fresh clam, Take a long time to cook for the clam. That would be enough for six. I'm going to bring that to a boil. Now it came back to a good boil. Now I'll finish it with cream, a good half a cup of Heavy cream here. You can even be a bit more generous with your cream if you want, but that's fine. So here it is. New England clam chowder, I put a bit of shine for color on top here. Okay. My New England clam chowder, happy cooking."

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Another one of my favorite from my garden in summer is cucumber soup. When the cucumbers start coming, they come all over the place. They are not particularly beautiful too, but I do soup. Gloria makes a great salad of sliced cucumber, Taking the seed out with sliced onion, and you cure the cucumber with salt, and it keeps couple of weeks in the refrigerator. Then I have mint also in my garden. So, some are pretty bad here, but I would pick up a good cup. You know, those proportion are not that important here. You like it with more mint, with less mint, with no mint at all. It's okay, but, here, we're about four people. I have a good two and a half pounds of cucumber and like a good cup of mint here, which, as I said, you know, could be a little more, as you can see, I mean, loose, loose mint in there. This is peppermint. It's quite strong. I put it in there, about two or three clove of garlic. This is small garlic. Again, it's made from my garden too. My wife will peel it. It's a pain in the neck to peel. Put it in there, and I have jalapeno pepper here. I think I'm going to put Maybe I don't know if I put till about half of one. Let's see whether it's strong. No, this one has practically no taste. I could probably put a whole one, too. And the next one, so you have to taste it because it does change. So okay. And your tolerance also, you may like it with a lot or with not much. Okay, now here is my cucumber. What I do, I cut the end of it, The garden and peel it, of course, So here with my cucumber, I cut the end of it until I see the seed here and around Piece here, piece here. Even if you have a few seeds in here, it doesn't really matter, but I usually avoid all centered with all those seed here. Here it is. Especially as I say, When those start coming in the garden, I can pick that up every day. Okay. All right. So here it is. I probably have a pound and three quarter here out of two and a half pounds. And I like to do it in the blender or the food processor is okay. I have a cup of water here. I'm gonna put about half of it to start. See, salt, a fair amount of salt. And let's see now. Okay. Let's see now. I tested this. Yeah, and I'm gonna put a good cup of yogurt here. And that's basically it. Let's see now what it tastes like. I need a little more salt in there. I think I put a a little pinch of sugar. I'm gonna put there. And my pepper was not very hot, so I'm gonna put a dash of Tabasco, but taste it. If your pepper is hot, you don't need to. Okay. So that's about here now. Let's see how much I have. Enough for four, practically. Yeah, you can see I have a good five cup here, a good five cup. You can have it a bit thinner if you want. Taste of summer. Look at that. Beautiful soup here. But you know what? I forget the olive oil in there. Usually, I put olive oil, Couple of tablespoon of olive oil in there. You know what? I'm going to put a little bit on top as a decoration, and I think it's gonna be beautiful. Anyway, yeah. Even if you put it in there, maybe you should put some like this. It looks good. And then a little spring of mint that I have here, and this is it. It's a nice elegant first coat for a summer dinner. Happy cooking. Soup."

        "transcription": [
            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I wanna show you a very simple but very straightforward roasted chicken sample. I have a beautiful chicken here, three pounds, three, three and a half pounds. The first thing that I do when I roast it, I remove the wishbone, which is that triangle here that you have on each side here. You can't feel it. You cut on each side, then after with your hand, your finger, and just push it forward to get to the end of it. Then put your finger on the back of it, your thumb in the back of it, and bring it back down. You know? So this is that wishbone here, which is really here, and it's a pain in the neck, textually, when you do the carving in the dining room, it's in the way, so I always remove it. Same thing with turkey, duck for that matter. Make sure that when you bite, you have enough that you have a bit of a skin here. The wing. I can bring in the back like this, and I can cook it this way, although I tend to like to truss it so that it hold a better shape. And what I use here is butcher twine. You know, don't use something in plastic. There is about five different way of trussing, with a trussing needle and so forth. This is without needle. And it's relatively simple. I go underneath like this, and you cross above. Then here, you go under the drumstick and close it. Then put it on the side here, turn it around, and bringing behind, behind the, the wing to anchor it. You do always do a couple, two or three turn like this because when you tighten it, it doesn't open, you know? So a second thing, and that's it. So my chicken is thrust, just like it hold a beautiful shape like this. So I'm gonna put a tablespoon of butter there in that. And then the seasoning, just salt and pepper. And I have about, you know, the salt inside. Salted all around. Likewise with the pepper. I will do some inside. And then a little bit on the outside. And I like to start it on the side. See, this is the the the leg, it's always longer to cook than the front. So I like to cook it this way, like twenty minute on this side, then twenty minute on the other side, and finely twenty minute turning it, and at that point, I can, at that point, I can baste it. You know, so here. This should be here. So here, I would start it on this side here. Roll it a little bit in butter. Then turn it around, go with this way, and that's going to go four twenty five degree, twenty minutes this way to start. So my chicken is twenty minutes now. Never go into the breast or whatever, but at the junction here, I go from this side to this side. And as you can see, this side is now beautifully brown. Yeah. So I'm putting on this side for the next twenty minutes. Twenty minutes on the other side, and now, again, I go on the side. And now here is my chicken. Now I put it on the back. Remember, all that time it was turned upside down. I didn't really have to baste it because the juice was going down. And that's why I put it this way. Now, form the gas. So now we start dasting it. So, start dasting it. So every three, four minutes, every, you know, five, six minutes, so you want to bake it a couple of times. It could go there for another twenty minutes for a total of one hour. Beautiful, right? Okay. Now my chicken is cooked. Obviously, I glaze it a few times. Blade it like this. Perfect roast chicken. One thing that you don't do now, often people do, they cover it, you know, with a with a piece of aluminum foil or whatever. For me, it tend to put moisture in it, and the moisture kind of soften it, and it end up being kind of, reheated. So here, as you see where I put my fork here, there, but never and I look at the color of the juice. The color is white. Okay. The chicken is cooked, so I put it there and leave it to rest for a couple of minutes before we carve it. Now we do the juice. And, of course, I could have done it in a pan which is not nonstick. In a sense, it would have been better for the sauce because on a north stick, the crystallization of the juice, it doesn't stay in the bottom of the pan, it separates. So here, I'm going to remove, well, most of the fat. Maybe I leave a tablespoon, hibout pintleur fat, and I will deglaze that with half a cup of chicken stock. But remember that what you have in the bottom, those things here, that's the glaze. That is the juice of the chicken who solidified in the bottom of the pan. And the process of deglazing is to add liquid to melt, to melt all of that type of thing, yeah, to melt it another half way here. What I wanna do here, again, removing the clear fat. And that clear fat is great to saute potato or anything like that. But the bottom, if there is any juice, I add it to this. Method. Let's see. I could have a dash of salt. That's how the salt is there. Maybe I will have a dash of soy, just to give me a little bit of color. Okay. So here, I have about a good half a cup of natural juice, and I'm going to thicken it with a bit of potato starch. I probably won't use all of that. A little bit of cold liquid you have to do. I have stock here. You already dilute it. As soon as that mixture touch, the liquid is thickened on contact. That's why you don't really have to worry that much about how much you put. I put some in it, stir it, and I look at it. Maybe a little more. Until I like the texture that he has. A dashboard. Okay. And now I wanna show you how to properly carve the chicken. So first thing. Of course, don't forget to remove the the twine, you know? This used to be done in the dining room, you know, with a fork and a spoon at that point. You would go on the side, cut the the bone here the the skin, rather. Break it at the bone. It come, and it comes out. As you can see, the chicken is perfectly cooked. The other leg in the same way. Because the hand you pull out. This. Now here, you have the joint of the shoulder. So I look for that joint here, which I have right there, and I cut a piece of the the breast. I mean, muscle. And again, you pull out this. Same thing on the other side. Again, the joint, I go down. You do the same thing with uncooked chicken, you know. Be exactly the same thing, the same process. And then pull out. Yes. So the two legs, the two breasts. Now we have what we call le brusche. That is the the white meat here. You cut on this and you pull it out. You know, it should come out of the bone pretty easily because it's cooked. Yeah. As you can see, it will come out and your back, your left weave, the whole carcass like this. The presentation used to be this. You know? It would be presented this way. The carcass, back in. You know? The bone back on top. The wing, the other wing, one leg, the other leg. That was a nice presentation. Usually, orange serve with a bunch of wildcress. I have a beautiful bunch of wildcress here. I will only use the top leaf, and, of course, this will make a great wildcress soup. So presentation of wild crust this way. And of course, we have the juice that we have here, the classic and this is it. Perfectly roast chicken with natural juice. Happy cooking"

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. One of the best thing we do at the first course, my wife love it, is gravlax. And the gravlax here, I'm doing it with salmon, and I call that an Assam gravlax. I'm I'm cutting it thin well, as thin as you can, really. Even if it's a bit thicker, it doesn't really matter. Notice that here, I have the the belly of the salmon. I think the belly of the salmon is probably the fattiest and one of the best. So I'm serving about an ounce and a half, two ounce, maybe par per second at the most for two. And, here we are. So I cut it into thin slice this way. And then let's say for two here, I have two plate. You put your salt right on top of it here, and be generous with the salt. It needs salt here. And then I'm putting my salmon Right there. Maybe this one here. And a little bit of salt on top And pepper. I should have put pepper underneath as well I'll do here. That's it. So what I do sometime when I have a party of five, six people or more, so I do that ahead. I bring those things right. I do all my portion ahead like this. Salt on top. And then I put a piece of plastic wrap on top of it, The other plate, another piece of plastic wrap. The other plate, six or eight people. I put that in the refrigerator. I can do that two, three, Three hours, even a day ahead, it's a vecti pan. When you're ready to serve, then you put your garnish in it. And the garnish can be A lot of different thing. In that case here, I have a few capers. So I'm gonna put capers. Capers goes well with it. I have onion and other those are, of course, vidalia onion. I mean, Onion, which are mild and so forth. You can put more stuff. You can put radish. I put in there, cucumber, stuff like this. I have a bit of Scallion green here. Maybe I'll put this. And I go usually to my Garden, see the type of herb that I have? I happen to have a little bit of basil here, so I will put the basil Shredded. But I will prepare all of my garnish. You see? And you get your salmon out of the refrigerator, all cured. You spread out all that top on top and you serve. And it's a great way of doing it. Always add a little bit of olive oil Around like this. Beautiful. Serve that with a black bread or a crunchy baguette. And if you serve lemon or lime, don't put it on top now because it's going to eat the protein In the salmon, then it look it it kind of cook it, so you put it on the side to serve it. When you serve, like, a lemon or a lime, don't cut it in the center. Cut it just off the center. See, you have a nicer cut here without the seed, and then that the way you put it around to press it.

I wanna show you how to handle it. First, I'm gonna put some Bacon or pancetta, we want to do a pretty strong sauce. Here, I'm doing it for two two, three people. I have three slice Three slices of bacon. So and I put a dash of olive oil on top because I will put the olive oil in the dressing. And I'm gonna cook that until it's nice and brown. Now here is they come out of the ground. Usually, You don't pick them up when the flowers is there. The flowers is what they do. You know, Italians do down lion wine, and that with the flower or the bud. But this one is small enough, so basically, you wanna go deep enough Into the ground to get the root here because the root is what's nice and white, as deep as you can go into the ground here. And often I split it in half. As you can see, this one here It's a bit bigger, so I have a nice bottom here. Cut the black. Clean up around. Maybe I cut it in half. Separate it. Oh, I have a bad leaf here, and that's it. This has to be washed two, three times, you know. I wash it when I do it. I let it soak in in water, you know, water out of the tap. I have about two, three cups here. And, of course, after it's washed it, I put them into the machine so that I really take the water out of it. So here, you can see this is cooking nicely here. I have bread in the oven also because we have crouton with that, and I have eggs. So when I do that for me, It's basically a whole meal. So here, we'll start with the garlic. Crush the garlic here. Maybe an another little piece. In Lyon, where I come from, Down lion is very big in summer. That's what I said. We call it pisce nly, p I s s e n c I l. And, often we do that with a smoked earring. So here, for two or three, I have a good teaspoon, teaspoon and a half of of garlic. I put anchovy paste or a couple of anchovy that you crush And put that. So here I will put, like, I would say, two good teaspoon of anchovy paste, Salt, of course, pepper, A dash of vinegar. Yeah. Not much, like a teaspoon of vinegar, you know? That will be the base of my mixture. And, of course, the oil that I have here and the fat from the bacon, that's going to go in the dressing as well. That's a lot of olive oil. So that's kinda ready. And I have my crouton right out of the oven. When I do crouton like this, I cut bread, like coarse bread like this, and, I sprinkle a bit a little bit of oil on top and put it into the oven. So that's one of the best way of doing it. So here is the rest of my dressing. So we'll mix it here. Remember, the anchovy paste, you have to crush it a little bit. Sometimes, you know, I only put The fat of the bacon here and keep the bacon to sprinkle on top. I could have done there. I forgot. And here, I have my down lion here. And I say when I do that, it basically are all meal for me. So we mix this. My father was very big down lion. I learned with him when I was a kid. You always say in spring, You have to eat dandelion at least three, four times to clean your blood. I was cleaning your blood. Okay. Highly seasoned. And I will serve that into a plate like this. A big, Yeah, big portion. I love the bacon. I like to put the bacon on top. Here it is. And then the croutons are going to go there. And finally, the eggs. And those eggs are cooked seven minute. Drop them in boiling water, Bring back to our bowl seven minutes, and then I cool them up too. So as you can see, they are still just slightly wet in the center. And This is right, the taste of my youth. Dandelion salad in the spring with the crouton, the eggs, and so forth. Happy cooking."

It comes back every year. Every year, I pull out half of it. It goes into seed here. I give some to France and it's still coming and coming. We have it from the end of April until, like, October. We are here. Oh, look at those. So the parsnips, you know, a type of carrot, too strong. It's very flavorful to braise around a roast. That's very good. A lot of basil.

The more we eat, the more it comes out. I mean, that's crazy. The zucchini flowers. And you can see that zucchini flowers with a thin stem like this in a male. So the male will not create any zucchini. So you take it out and we fry it, you know, fry zucchini flower. If you see that underneath there is a bulge, that is going to create a zucchini so you don't pick it up. Only the male one. Favorite for me when I was a kid, certainly the Swiss chard. Swiss chard, we make gratin or Swiss chard or Stuff like this too. A lot of chives in many of my recipe, family of onion and all that time chives, I have it in three or four place in the garden. And I cut when it comes out with the with the flowers, I cut it down. It grows again with the flowers. I cut it down. You do that a couple of times and after the flower don't come anymore. That's it. Springtime, we have some of the tomato coming out here. See, another week or so. I pick some up every day when they are ready. I think it's time to make green fried tomato. I have sorrel here. And sorrel is a sour, kind of sour grass sorrel. And we do that especially with salmon, that classic thing. Very high in oxalic acid and all that. We soak it.

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. There is a famous dish in the southwest of France called cassoulet. And it's, you cook beans usually. There is duck in it. All kind of sausage in it. It's a very famous dish, which now I'm going to do a kind of bastardized version of it, very easy to do. And I'll start by putting a little bit of olive oil in there, and I have three sausages that I find in my freezer. Seasoned Italian type sausage, which is raw meat, so I'm gonna cut that into pieces like this. Okay. Because this has to cook. I'm gonna put that to cook directly in there. Okay. And then I have two other sausages here. This is a type of bratwurst whole kielbasa, bit of the same idea, those are cooked sausage. So bacon go later. And this is, as you can see, a hot dog. So that's good too. All right. I am going to put an onion. And this, of course, we can do it ahead. You can do it, of course, with dry beans, but, it makes it very easy to do in a few minutes here. This is like this. And the garlic, you know, just got three shots and cooked in there. Alright. Go. Just cook at two, three minutes till maybe I could add this to it. That. I'm gonna saute that for a minute. And what I have here, I have a can of, Well, cannellini beans or butter beans or white tiny white beans. You know, you Anyway, even the red beans too, it's a question of choice what you have in your refrigerator. And to cook piece, what I'm going to do is to pour the the water that I have in there. Yeah. And I'm going to cook for a few minutes for a couple of minutes with that water. Actually, I could even cover that two, three minute. And during that time, I can do my garnish here For the hands. So as you see, I have a little piece of tomato, probably third of a cup or so. Bit of garlic. I can. There can never be enough garlic for me. So I chop that. And if I were to do that ahead, I would do what I did there. And after, I'm going to add the other sausage in it too, but I would not add what I have here, which is parsley, the tomato and the garlic, I would add that only when I'm serving it, just to bring it to a bowl and serve it, but that you could do that a few hours ahead. Yeah. That's fine. I can see this has cooked. Yeah. The onion is about cooked. So let's put the rest of it in there, the sausage. And of course, you know what? I'll add a little bit of water to that. Rinse my can, put water, and that basically has to come to a boil and boil one, two minute to warm up the sausage and the beans. Yeah. This has been boiling for a couple of minute now. Alas, I'll add my garnish. Stir it in there. It'll be beautiful. Just have to come back to a boil, and let's see what it tastes like. We need salt. Again, there is no salt in in the beans and pepper. That, I may even put a dash of Tabasco in there. And this is it. You can do that ahead, of course. And the reheated is always good reheated. I wanted to do it for two. I probably have close to enough for four, but you would serve it in a bowl like this. In there. Hey. Even with a little bit more herbs on top if you want. And this is our make up cassoulet. Easy to do, a few minute, great taste, and happy cooking."

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. When I was an practice many, many years ago, one of the things that we had to learn was how to flute a mushroom, turn a mushroom, or flute a mushroom. It takes a lot of practice to do that, and it's not that particularly useful, but I want to show you how to do it. You use your thumb as a pivot here like this. The sometimes people take it here and use this other pivot. One or the other, I tend to do that. You go there. You go to the center and do like this. You know, you turn all around. The mushrooms should be very firm, of course, to do that. And then when you finish here, you clean up, of course, your mushroom to have that kind of spiral mushroom that you do, which as I say, requests a lot of practice, And it's basically useless. Well, I'll show you another way, another decoration, which is much easier to do, and you use only a little bit of the mushroom, you take a large mushroom like that and you cut the top. Now this become a canvas and you draw something, sometimes I may draw a chicken too. In that case here, I'm gonna draw a fish. So I draw a fish out of it here. Okay. Here is my fish. I'm going to mark the fish. And then after you mark the fish, you cut around to create a relief, to create a relief like this so that The fish stand out on top. Then when you have the fish standing out, you trim the outside. And ultimately, you cut a little slice of this where you have your decoration on top. So meaning you don't use almost none of your mushroom, only that little piece with you, put a bit of lemon juice on top so it doesn't discolor, and you have a nice decoration to put on top of a broiled fish or or a mushroom soup or something like that. I hope you enjoy it. Happy cooking."

I have two breasts of chicken, and I'm going to put, oh, half a teaspoon of salt on it. I would say a good teaspoon of hot sauce. This is, maybe a teaspoon and a half. This is garlic chili sauce, but you could use other types if you want. So I spread that underneath, Put that into a gratin dish this way.

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. You know, one of the the best thing that I do is what we call fromage four, French cheese. This is a recipe inspired by my father. He used to do that many, many years ago at that time, we didn't have food processor, anything. So we used to get leftover cheese from hard cheese to to goat cheese to whatever, put them with a bit of white wine and some bouillon, some soup, and put them in a jar and let it fermentate in the cellar. Then you mash it up into a puree, the and that's what we call the fondness for. So that's what I do here. A lot of people throw cheese out. Look at all that array of cheese. I I went through all my refrigerators here, freezer. So usually, I would start with the hard cheese to do in there. So, the see what it looks like. You know, you may have to trim it. Like here, maybe I'll trim a little bit of the outside here. But I mean, even if there is a bit of mold, the you know, cheese, especially like blue cheese, is is what it is, you know, balls. So it's fine. The so here, I will cut it into pieces like this. I have that piece of Swiss cheese here. Maybe I'll take the this out of it. Okay. I have a mimelette here. Mimelette is really hard. That I'm gonna trim that, a skin on the other side. And of course, the recipe that I am doing will never be the recipe that you do. It's never the same because depending what's left over. And what you have to look at, look how much of the hot cheese you have, how much of the soft cheese that you have. Because if not, you may even add the a little bit of, cream cheese or maybe a couple of tablespoon of sour cream or something like that to soften the thing. Although, we are going to put white wine in it. So I have a piece of, Saint Alboy here. This is a pretty strong sheet, and I'm I think I'm trimming the the the outside a little bit. It's a bit strong. A piece of blue cheese here. I think this one is rocquer. I'm creaming the outside. This one, maybe a little bit here. This is like a gorgonzola so it's a much softer cheese. I have some the feta cheese here, as you can see. I have a little piece of camembert. Well, I can even leave the the rind in it. The rind is not damaged. It's fine. And here, I kind of sample it with a very strong cheese where I'm going to cream that also. So this is my soft cheese. I I'm going to start. Okay. I have a pound of cheese altogether here. Oh, and I have a the slice here of, you know, the the American cheese, you know, that's good. Anything good. I have, like, four clove of garlic here, I'll I'll drink, crush them a little bit, put them in the food processor. The you can have less garlic or more. For me, there is never enough garlic, so I love garlic. Okay. The so here, I'll start with the garlic. I'm gonna put my hot sheet in there. The them. The the well, look. It looks pretty thick still. So I'll put the rest of the the wine here. I'm gonna put a lot of, pepper that I put in it. Usually, you don't need salt because the the the chili is salty enough, but sour bread is good to taste it. I'm gonna clean that around. The you know, I put that on top of soup. I put it in pasta. The I put it in gratin. Gratin dish goes very, very well with it. I, put it in gougeres, you know, the little cream puff dough that you do. The little cream puff dough that you do with cheese in it, as you see. Quite a lot of fromage four. The the best way usually, the way we use it is just like this, on toast, and that's how I like it. Just like this. The sometime, we put it in the oven to brown it under the broiler. It's interesting because when you put it into the oven, it get milder that when you have it untoasted. And this is going to take a couple of minutes under the broiler. The little container for me to freeze it. The and I think I'll keep this one in the refrigerator to use in the next couple of days. The and here it is, beautifully golden. And as I say, interestingly enough, this is the less strong than this, that's how I like it. And that's how you save moleh. Use your leftover cheese and do something absolutely delicious with it.

So check it out when your pasta is cooked each one. About twenty minutes. Then I got my the beans. All of that have to come to a boil now and that's about it. I like to put a tablespoon or so of butter at the end here to enrich it a little bit. Couple of tablespoon of chives or parsley. Now it came back to a boil.

        "transcription": [
            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Today, I'm I'm going to show you how to make candied peel of citrus fruit. Very expensive in the store and very easy to do. I use the vegetable peeler to take long strips. This is a grapefruit. Of course, I have orange, which is mostly I do usually with the orange. And as you can see with this, I'm taking only the top part of the skin, and that's relatively important. So I have like a dozen, one, we're gonna have lemon as well, you know, and all of that I will put into boiling water to blanch it, it has to be blanched. Otherwise, it gets very bitter. Now, you don't want to take the thick part of it because if you take like, the whole part here where you have the white piece underneath, it's not you can do it with that, but you have to blanch it at least two or three times, otherwise, it's bitter. But it is in that part that you have most of the essential oil. Do you see that? I have some of the essential oil coming out of it. And, and this, again, in the lemon the same way too. And this is where you have most of the taste, in the top, in those essential oil. So this boil for like ten seconds, ten, fifteen seconds usually. And I will drain it. I will drain it in the sink normally. And you can already see the color of that water, you know, it's already and I would run that out, but you don't have to. Back in there now, I have about three quarter of a cup of water, half a half a cup of sugar, and now this is going to cook. Okay. As you can see now, it's boiling. It's boiling nicely. And, but the syrup is still very light now. So now it's going to take probably ten, twelve minutes at least to go where I want it to go before we dump it in sugar. Okay. Now, you can see the bubble the way it cooked. Now, it's cooked and I've hit to a break stage. So I'm gonna stop this. Yeah. And it's, yeah, nine minute. Nine minutes. So what we do now with this, you want to lift up those, those things and put them in sugar. Okay. One, two, three. Because you want to saturate them with sugar, you can see, for example, that this is this is the grapefruit, and it has a different slightly different color than the orange. And, this is that's it. You have a syrup here leftover and, you could use that syrup, of course. Keep it for, to do a cocktail with it or something else, but here it is. So what we want there is to saturate that in sugar on each side, you know. Here, there, here, there. Them flat. Okay. Here we are. So here, I did it a couple of times. So now I can use my finger to really You know, it has to be saturated totally with sugar so it doesn't stick anymore. We do that for Christmas. You know, very often I do it to give it to friend. In ten, fifteen minutes, half an hour, they're going to be hard, and you cannot even keep it. If you keep it like this outside, it get too hard, braison. So what you do, you put it into a a little plastic box like this, you know, and then you can keep them for weeks in your refrigerator. Now you can even make it a bit fancier. You would wait until it's hard because it is not hard enough. Now I have some chocolate here that I melted. And, you would, for example, the orange veer, tip it maybe halfway through, putting there to cool off, you know. And let's say with, well, with the with the lemon, let's say, you could do white chocolate, and it'd be different. Okay. Now, if you do it with the chocolate, you can keep it as long in your box, you would keep it without, but you can still keep it for like a week. So here we go. It's very easy to do that I can put that in my refrigerator for a few minute. That's it. About half an hour in the refrigerator, but you can leave it the whole day. It doesn't matter. Notice that I put it onto nonstick, aluminum foil. You know, the part on the that this is shiny. No, the unshiny part is the nonstick one. So here is how you can see. Probably, but here it is hard now. I love to do that for, for the holiday, you know, Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving or whatever, I love for the holiday to do chocolate like this. And here. Another one here. And you can see here, beautiful with chocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate, milk chocolate. Any one of that is fine. And did a beautiful dessert and a great gift to give to your friend. Happy cooking."

Here, I'm going to put the whole the whole jalapeno because, as I said, doesn't have much taste. And, of course, some cilantro there. Coursefully chopped, and I would say one, two, a good two tablespoon. And to this, I wanna use probably I'm moving the seed here. With a good tablespoon, tablespoon and a half maybe of lemon juice. It's up to you. And I would say a good, One, two tablespoon of olive oil. Then with that salt, a quarter of a teaspoon of salt, then always taste it. A sec. And more salt. I like to present it into a nice bowl. All kind of variation on that. Less pepper, more pepper, no olive oil, garlic. It's a question of taste. You know, you adjust them. Sometimes you do it one way, sometimes you do it another way. That's a great order I used to do certainly when I spent time in Mexico.

Now we remove The segment. Now the segment here, you can see between each membrane, I cut with a knife at the first one here, And I remove it. The second one, I cut next to the membrane, I twist my knife around, and I come back next To the next membrane. That's one word here. And some of them, like, for example, this one is going to be smaller. Sometime, it's thicker leaves. Sometime, of course, like here, I have some, seed in it. You have to deal with that. Okay. We're back, forth. Again, this is a thin one. You see? It's a big one. You go all around exactly the same thing with an orange, exactly the same thing with a lemon. Here.

As you can see, That one was quite large, and I may not use the whole thing. But it's really a refreshing dessert That you can use, and providing that you have a this cookie with that, you would put maybe a little bit of those around As a garnish. Okay.

Of course, this is a garnish that you don't have to do. You can serve that with spinach. You can serve that with carrots. You can serve that with potato. And, I wanna put, a Couple of tablespoons of oil in there. With olive oil. And this doesn't have to saute very long. This one I may cut right through. You could eat the end of it. And at the end of it, it doesn't seem to have as much seed as it has on the other side. Salt, and then I'm gonna saute that for a couple of minutes. Here, I'm gonna cut that on the side into scallopini like this that is long. As I said, we used to do that a lot with veal. I can do the same way here. Sometimes we bread it. We used to bread the veal. One, two, three. Maybe this one a little bigger. I cut it to open it this way. So they're all about the same thickness. This is going to cook a minute on each side. Salt on top of this, on each side. I could also put flour, but not going. A bit of Spanish paprika. This side. This side, and eventually, I'll put a bit of shallot at the end. I cut that in half. Okay, this is about ready. You could do that a little bit ahead, keep that warm. In, you know, one hundred and thirty, one hundred and forty degree oven.

There is a bone in between, of course. My mother used to do a stew with that, and this is what I want to do to show it today. And as you can see, there is a fair amount of fat, and I'm cutting between the rib here. And, the idea, of course, For me, it would be to try to eliminate as much fat as possible here. Okay. And, for this, I'm gonna put it into a very heavy saucepan like this without anything And let it cook, I would say, twenty, thirty minutes browning it all around to remove as much as fat to melt as much as fat Out of, this, and then we'll continue after. So I start here. And of course, you could do it in a larger one So that it would be all flat, but it but it's okay. I'm gonna turn it around and so forth as it cooked. I will start on Very high heat so that it brown a little bit. And then after, I will lower the heat on lower, partially cover it Halfway like this and let it brown and turn it all around. Okay. As you can see, this has been browning, And I have a lot of fat coming out of it, and that was the idea. So I wanna pour out that fat now Let's see here. Okay. And as you can see here, I have practically, practically a cup of fat. Now this mayonna be totally defiled, But most of it is gone. So now the next step, I will cut that onion coarsely. Okay. Took it right in there. Three or four clove of garlic here. And you see I crush it coarsely like this, and that's fine. I want, the onion just to Cook a few seconds here with the garlic. I have one tablespoon or maybe one and a half, One and a half tablespoon of flour. We call that sanger, to singe. And just move it a little bit Like this so the flour disappears. Then let it dry. That's it. Now I wanna put two cup of water in there. And I will tell you to put water rather than stock because Lamb is strong enough, doesn't need stock. A little bit of fresh thyme here, or thyme from my garden. A couple of bay leaf And that's it. I want to bring that to a boil and cook it like five minutes or so, five, ten minutes. So here I have my vegetable. So I have carrot. So now it's cooking, as I said, for about five minutes, just about the time for me to do those Chebonne, here's the white turnips. This, of course, can be done ahead. You can use yellow turnip as well, but it ends up being a bit stronger, usually. Potato. Okay. And I could put all the vegetables. If I had a tomato or two, I'll put it in. This is the type of stew you're about your friend to eat because you have to eat those bone, use your hand. But it's delicious. Here now it's boiling. And as you can see, I have a little bit of flour here. Not much, but it give me enough of a thickening agent. It's going to reduce to be kind of creamy like this. Oh, well, no salt, no pepper in it yet. So make sure you put your salt in there, pepper, And I'm putting all my vegetable in there. About six ribs, six, seven ribs. You have two ribs, three ribs per person. There is not that much Meat around, you know? So that would be enough anyway for two, three, four, depending the rest of the dinner. So that's about it. Now I'm bringing it to a boil, lowering the heat, and cooking it for thirty minutes. Okay. So it is basically cooked now. Thirty, thirty five minutes. You add the peas, and this is it.

            "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. We make soup at home. Winter, summer, turn the garlic into a cold soup, hot soup. I want to show you how to make a very easy one. I have a quart of chicken stock here. Of course, if you don't have a quart of chicken stock, you can use water and about a tablespoon and a half, two tablespoons of chicken base. So I want to bring that to a boil and cook that with a leek here. Leek is great for mince soup. As you can see, that leek is a little bit damaged. It's been around in the refrigerator for a while. So I will remove those first two things here. Probably up to here. Snow good here. A bit of the end here. What you want to do is to cut it in half this way, this way, and that's when you rinse it underwater. You know, all that beautiful light green color, that's what you want. So here it's clean. So now, of course, you could put scallion if you don't have the leek or even onion too, but I like. And as you can see, I use a lot of the green too. I think it's a mistake to remove all of this. I mean, very often, I leak, may cost up to a dollar a piece. And I've thinned people just cutting it up just to keep that part. No. Use the whole thing. Okay. I want my stack to come to a boil. Want to put this in there. I just have to wait for that to come to a boil and boil a couple of minutes. Okay, this has been boiling for like three, four minutes, and that's fine. So I'm going to add a little flake to it. And of course, those are instant cooking, you know. I I have about a cup and a half ish, so I don't know whether I'll need the whole thing. I want to taste it. Oops, no salt. I need salt in there and pepper. Remember, the stock that I had was no seasoning. Maybe I put a dash of Tabasco, like a few, a few drops. So you can serve it just as is. But of course, if you want to put a little bit of cream in it, have some heavy cream. You could put light cream. You can even put milk, you know. And I think that I put here maybe a third of a cup. At that point, that soup can be almost like a bichyssoise, a cold soup, you know, and it can be served this way. I have the shives coming out now and even with the flowers of the shive, which sometimes I use as a decoration. That's a very elegant soup. Maybe a couple of chives on top. And maybe those flour here, which are edible. Taste a little bit like garlic. And this is this, instant potato soup for a nice dinner. Happy cooking."

            "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I used to cook Brussels sprouts in water. When they were cooked, we saute it and all that. I do it in a different way now, and this is a must for me for it certainly for Thanksgiving. So I like to do them with a little bit of bacon like this. If you don't want to, you can only use the olive oil, it's perfectly fine. To decide not to. I have about two ounces of bacon here, and I have half a pound of Brussels sprouts. And I good, maybe a tablespoon of olive oil there. So this we want to cook for, you know, a couple of minutes until it's nice and crunchy an onion. I may even cover it so that it doesn't splatter too much. And then my, Brussels sprouts here. What I do, I cut them into thin slices like this. Now actually, if I have a lot, I do it in my food processor. I have a blade, I go that. As you can see, those are quite nice. Those here, if you feel that they need help sometime when you buy them, then you will have to cut the bottom if it's brown, remove a little bit of the damaged leaf, but I mean, those are fine. Okay. So here, those two pounds, those half a pound of, would be enough for like two, three people. So here, about fine now. So that's it. I'm going to add a little bit of salt, not too much because of the bacon. Definitely a fair amount of pepper. I have enough the moisture will come out of the Brussels sprouts. You don't think it does enough, then you can put, you know, a tablespoon of water and cover it. They're going to get soft, just slightly crunchy still. They'll cook in two, three minutes, couple of minutes. Wanna test it? Two. Nice crunchy, a little firm. Test it. It's already important. You like it this way, go. Like it less cooked, fine, because it's more cooked, fine, there is no rule for that. Now maybe I need a dash of olive oil on top still. Great dish for Thanksgiving. I'll set my Thanksgiving Brussels sprouts. Happy cooking."

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I'm making steak. Grandma today, named after Julia, my mother-in-law, who was from Puerto Rico, and, loves steak with lime or lemon. Usually, she use lime. I don't have lime, so I'm using lemon. So I'm anchovy fillet some garlic too, and those are the butcher steak. An oven. This is the skirt steak, which is inside the animal. This is the oyster steak, like the oyster and the chicken, or the shoulder steak. The shoulder blade steak, it come under the name top blade steak, flat iron steak. That probably would be my favorite. So with this, I'm gonna put some salt on top of it. This is the one, and this is a skirt steak. And the skirt steak is good too, what they use usually for fajita and stuff like this, but, my favorite is still this one if you can find it at the butcher or at your supermarket. I'm going to put maybe a tablespoon of butter in there and, a couple of teaspoon of oil. I'm gonna do some lime or in that case, lemon rind. Here I have it here, which I'm gonna put in there, a little piece of lemon that I'm going to squeeze on it at the end. I have garlic here. So two small clove of garlic, that and a couple of anchovy fillets that I have here that I'm going to chop with the garlic. Here is my steak ready to go. A couple of minutes on each side. Here we are. Here. This is a wonderful mixture of garlic and, anchovy fillet here. I put that in there. Essentially a good tablespoon of chopped parsley. We'll put that at the end of it. And I wanna saute around the steak at the end, maybe a little bit. I have one mushroom here. I don't think we had that in the original recipe, but just happened to have it in my refrigerator, so I'm gonna use it. Just chop it coarsely like this. Let's see my steak here. Beautifully brown. It is better, of course, if you have a chance of letting your meat rest. If it rests a couple of minutes before you serve it, it equalize the color. I can touch it like that. The way it bounce back will tell me how cooked it is. You know, raw meat is very mushy, and it start cooking and it start bouncing. If at that point, it doesn't bounce back, it's just hard, then it's well done. You know, so it's somewhere in between and you get used to it in the kitchen, of course. What I'm going to do is probably put my, my mushroom here. And and I think it's cooked enough. This, so I will have it this way. Here it is. Those steak are about five ounces, small sticks, but we don't really use more than that. So here, to deglaze the pan with a bit of juice, I put like a tablespoon of of water in it. Then I'm gonna put that mixture in it. Just stir it. And that's it. I'm gonna put that on top of my steak. Good. And don't forget a nice squeeze of lime or lemon. Steak Grand Maire. So let me see the inside. And here is to you, Julia. It would be about rare like this the way we like it. Of course, you can cook it longer. I hope you enjoy that. Bon appetit, and happy cooking."

And then she tell me much less calories this way. So I do the French fry sometime this way. In that case, here, I left the skin on. You can remove the skin if you want. Well, if it's a bit damaged here, Remove at the end. Maybe a little bit of this. Your standard French fry. So here I have a pound and a half of potato. Let's serve that. That would serve a few people. One, two, okay. So we wash the potato, and, you wanna drain them out. Dry them out. They should be dry. I can use a towel or paper towel. Usually I use paper towel just to use that, but To dry it out. And you put your oven at four twenty five degrees, so pretty hot, hot oven. See, you see your potato. When you do any type of potato, you keep it in water. Otherwise, it discolor. Of course, so here, I have enough potato for probably at least four people, depending what else you eat. Okay, so it's about dry here. I'm gonna put two, three tablespoons maybe of oil. In that case, I'm using A peanut oil, two, well, maybe three. At that point, I'll put also a little bit of Paprika, like maybe a teaspoon of paprika. This is Spanish Paprika, give me some color, and maybe some Herbes de Provence, like a teaspoon or so also. No salt now. I'll put the salt later on. So you know, mix it so that you have your oil All over. And then on a nonstick pan like this, Put that into the oven and see what happens. If it doesn't work, that's Claudine's fault. Okay, four twenty five degrees coleslaw, maybe forty five minutes. This is it. Right out of the oven, A little bit of salt on top.

Good in my daughter is hooked on that and as well as my granddaughter. So I have often my own stock like I have here, but this is very, very, very weak. There is no salt in it. So often to strengthen it, I put a little bit of that that pays the chicken base here, and this one is an organic one, so it's good to have, or regular, I can buy chicken chicken stock also that you can buy one or the other. Oh, And I'll put a bit of salt in there because as I said, it's one of the in seasoning, I have about six cup of stock here.

Often we have rice, or sometimes I go to the Chinese restaurant And they have rice and I take what's left. And, and that's it. This, other time it boils a couple of minute. I put my vermicelli inside as well. And here I have about a cup of it. Should have about two ounces. You could do it thicker or not as thick or whatever. Let it bring back to a boil and boil like four or five minutes at the most and it's ready. This, I'll put that in there in a little while. Okay. A chive. So sometimes for lunch when I don't know what to do for lunch, I have that and my wife is happy with that. I always like to put a little bit of cheese in it. For me, my favorite one is Swiss cheese. That and this is, you know, jal'sburg or a montaler or, you know, gruyere or any of this, it finds. So this is it with another three, four minutes, and we can serve it with the cheese. That's it.

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Today, I wanna show you how to make couscous. And couscous, you know, is a semolina. It's, it's wheat, regular wheat, which is granulated, And you can buy it uncooked, but usually, it come precooked. So you cover it with boiling water or stock, and that's it. So it's very easy to do, but I wanna show you how to do a vegetable couscous here. And what I have, I'm gonna put a tablespoon of Butter here and about a tablespoon of olive oil. I have half a cup of onion in there. Okay. I have a couple of, of mushroom here. Two, three mushroom, coarsely, chopped, which is also going about half a cup. Cook all those vegetable for a minute or so, then I'll Put tomato. I have one tomato. Cut into cube. Probably would have enough with this, but I don't wanna waste it. I'll put the whole tomato in it. One cup of tomato. Put the vegetable. Let's say two two cup loos of spinach, baby spinach. That melt do nothing. Like, a container like this, It's five ounces. I didn't even take half of it. And I think I can add my tomato. So frankly, you can have any vegetable you want. So here is the couscous here. I have a cup of couscous here. Usually, you put about the same amount of liquid in it. Since I have a little bit of that, I may put three quarter cup of chicken stock. Just put salt. And I want to let it cook another three, four minutes because remember, when When I mix the couscous in it, the boiling stock, I cover it, leave it on the side. See, there's no more cooking. Alright. I think my vegetable cooked enough here. I'll make my couscous in it. Shut the heat up. Mix the couscous, And I have three quarter of a cup of boiling stock here I'm going to add to it. Should we take one? That's it. Cover it, five minute, that's it. This is it. I can see it's a bit different this way, but so what you have to do is what you call eggronaire in France to fluff it. Make it fluffy. Well, as you can see, with one cup, one cup of couscous, I do quite a lot. So, of course, this would be a a great garnish for a for a roast chicken to fish. It doesn't stick at all too. So this is it. Good. And what I wanna show you, you know, when I have when I do a puree of potato, a puree of other thing, rice, pasta, sometime, all this. When I have Any leftover, which I often do, this is what I do for lunch the day after. So let's say this is leftover. So I have a bunch of those, whoop, leftover here. I do it this way. I create a a nest here. Of course, at that point, it's a bit different because the mixture is cold here, and I put an egg in the middle of it. Be my lunch. On top of that, a little bit of Gruyere cheese, you know. Maybe a dash of hot sauce. A few drops. Or even maybe a bit of Herb, if I have it here, cover it. Always cover with, with paper towel, you know, and, in the microwave for a minute. Okay. I end up putting it two or three times. I put it on one minute. I I put it on another twenty second, and then another fifteen, twenty seconds. So this is the way I like it here. The whites are set, and the yolk is still quite liquid as you see. This is the way I like it the way my wife like it, so I hope you make that couscous. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, and happy cooking."

It's it's, percille in French, And I is garlic. So, it's a mixture of parsley and garlic. I also call it, you know, in France, we eat frog. And this is the same way we saute frog. So, here I have one breast of chicken and again, that breast, that single breast of chicken is going to be plenty For two people, you know, I could do different garnish with it, a vegetable, but this is just sauteed This way. Okay. Here, I'm going to put a good A good tablespoon and a half of butter and probably just the same amount of oil In there. Okay. Now I put salt On the chicken, pepper And flour. So I wanna put, you know, to coat it with the flour. Couple of tablespoons of flour, and that should do at the last moment because it gets gooey, you know, as you can see. I wanna drain it out from the flour and go directly into my pan here. And this is the way we do, you know, frog leg. The leg is really I just saute Like that in butter and oil and finish with the persillade, the parsley, and the garlic. I can see that they are browning nicely. Gonna start turning them. I mean, I could saute you like this. Cool. Doesn't take much more than like three minutes to cook those little piece of chicken breast. You have to be very careful with chicken breast Not to overcook it. Should be cooked, but still moist instead and juicy. Now let's see my garlic. I have a pair of garlic here. Two or three. I mean, this is a larger one. Those are smaller ones. So you wanna crush your garlic. And don't worry about the green shoot that you have. I remember years ago, people say you have to remove that, it's bitter. Well, I did remove it for a number of years until I went to China and realized that the fresh garlic coming out of the garden, there is that sprout coming out of it. Probably the most tender part of the garlic, and I never removed it again. Okay. Parsley. Maybe a little bit of chive. The chive you cut this way. You don't really have to chop it like the parsley. I remember my mother cooking. She sauteed potato. She put persillade or the parsley garlic mixture at the end. Okay. I can see now. Here, you see. This is cooked. I freeze it as you see because the center would be Turning white again. It's very moist. So You add your perforillade. Thought you do that at the last moment because it doesn't take any Time.

        "transcription": [
            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. When I cook lamb, you know, very often, I look for lamb. Lamb chops are great. Well, the best lamb chops for me is this one. This is the shoulder lamb chop. See the bone of the shoulder here at the blade. For me, this is moisture and more tender than, than the loin even and much less expensive. Sometimes there is more fat than it is here. I try to choose one with the least amount of fat. There is still some fat in the center. It's like the Boston butt that you have, you know, in the pork. The shoulder makes a great roast. I need the same piece here. So salt, pepper on top of this. Of course, I often grill it, But here we're sauteing it in a skillet. I'm gonna put like half a tablespoon of oil, you know, corn oil with the same amount of butter. We're gonna saute that. Of course, I like it medium rare in the center. So have it cook for a few minutes, couple of minutes here, going to lower the heat a little bit, and I'm going to put a garnish of mushroom. I have those mushroom here, a little oil from my refrigerator, so they need washing. It is a fallacy that you cannot wash mushroom, course you wash mushroom. The point is that you don't do it ahead. You wash mushroom and you use them as fast as you can after. I have two large mushrooms that I'm going to put, cooked gently all around here. So that's gonna cook a couple of minutes on this side, a couple of minutes on the other side. So now it's about three minutes. Turn my lamb chops here. And mushroom too. Cook it another two, three minutes on this side as well. Dash of salt on the mushroom. And maybe I put a little bit of garlic at bean, I have a nice slice of garlic, and maybe I will just do some slice of garlic like this. Then we'll add them at the end. See, another three minutes on each side. I can touch it like that, and I know it's still pretty rare. But good, now it has to rest. I'm putting my garlic in there now. Two slice of garlic. Just close. I'm setting up the heat. So it's just up the heat now. And I leave it here. I'm gonna cover it. And maybe three, four, five minutes. The point is I don't want it to get cold, but also when the meat cooked, it shrank like this, and all the juice got toward the center on on the other side. So when the meat is finished cooking, you have to let it rest a little bit. So the meat deconstructed. It was contracted when it cooked. It deconstructed, and the juice runs through it, and it's pink from the beginning to the end. Otherwise, you end up with the outside, which is kind of gray, overcooked, and the inside, which is almost raw. So the resting is important on something like that, three, four, five minutes on a steak, on a rack of lamb, like eight, ten minutes, understanding rib roast, like thirty, forty five minute. Okay. I think it rested long enough now. We we can see that when it dries, the juice come out of it. Whoop. My garnish here. See the juice released. It's released a fair amount of juice. Mushroom here. That's a nice, a nice garnish. And you see the natural juice, This side of garlic. That's it. Of course, a bit of green on top of it, always finish. That's it. Should be rested. So can see cut right in the center is going to be beautifully medium rare, just the way I like it. Of course, if you like it longer, you cook it longer if you like it more cooked. And this is it. The lamb shoulder with mushroom saute. Happy cooking."

Very nicely sharpening. Okay. Okay. We're browning a little bit here. Nicely. For two, three minutes. I put the onion, I'm going to go with it, and one, two cloves of garlic. Crush it first, and then cut it. And chop it closely. Maybe the garlic. I think I need a little more oil, so I would put probably two tablespoons to start with. And here I have a pepper, which sometimes is hot, sometimes it's not. It's a poblano pepper and the poblano pepper. Sometime you taste it, it's really pretty hot. Some of the time it's not. So here, I will cut it coarsely. In there. Okay. I will add that to it. Beautiful color. And then in there, probably half a cup of diced tomato. And I use, usually use Italian diced tomato. A good half a cup. Yes. And my red beans. I'm gonna pour some of the water out, about half of it. I still keep some in there. Of the stew here. You want to taste it with a bit of salt. Yeah. You want them to cook for five minutes so the pepper is cooked, and the onion and so forth. I'm going to put some cilantro at the end. When I buy cilantro, very often I buy the bunch of cilantro, I cut the front, the leaves. I use them within one or two days, and the rest of it, like this one is, I put that in the freezer. And this has a lot of, taste, the stem. So when you cut it here, it kind of crumble. It kind of crumble into but I always, when I do, especially stew or beans, I use cilantro, a lot of it, then I use the stem. This has as much taste as the leaf, if not more. I'm putting that in there. And this is it. You can put your pan right in the middle of the table or put it into a dish like this. Kind of one or the other, but with a beautiful stew.

            "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Many years ago, I was in New York at James Beard house. I was very friends with James Beard, you know, in the 60s, 70s and so forth. One time I was at his house, he was doing his famous onion sandwich. I've done it several times home because my wife loves it. So I want to show you how to do it. And, those were a round sandwich. So if you have a cutter like this, you can cut it with this. Try to get it to lose the least amount of bread, and I have that, that glass. Well, it's not very, cutting, but I can still Cut it after with a knife just to mark it. Yeah. Okay. And, So I will cut it a little bit here. And remember that you always keep the the trimming, you know, to do breadcrumb. I already do breadcrumb with those creaming. You put that in the food processor, and you have beautiful fresh breadcrumb, and, it is actually quite different than the breadcrumbs that you buy. Because the one which is dry, You have much more bread in it. So here, I have two round things. We want to put mayonnaise on top of it. Chairs with mayonnaise. What's up here? Again, here. And the slice of onion. You could add an onion the same size on your sandwich, a good slice, Probably a bit harder. A bit easier to do it with half onion and cut two thin slices like this. One, two. That's it. What you wanna do now, A little bit of salt on top of it. We'll get the salt. Then the other slice of bread. Really glue it together. And what you want to do now is to put A little bit of mayonnaise on the outside if, of course, we can prepare ahead. And finally, I think James Beard did it with parsley. In that case, I'm doing it with shives. Just dip it into shires like that. Beautiful onion sandwich here that I can cut in half. And this is one sandwich that my Wife loved. Well, James Beard sandwich gave me an idea for another sandwich. In France, we already have radish with butter and, and bread and salt on top of it. So I'm gonna do a a radish sandwich at that time, instead of mayonnaise, here I'm using butter. Okay. Sweet unsalted butter, which which is what I use at home. Okay. And then the radish. So you can cut The radish drops them very thin like that, which is what I'm doing here. Okay. So I have a bunch of radish here, Very thinly sliced. I'm gonna fill up the bread with that. Here's here. There. On top. Here. Here, love radish. Beer salt. The other bread on top. Glue it together, then I'm gonna trim it. This one is going to be square. That's not around, but doesn't really matter. Okay. And on the side, in the same way, I'm gonna put a little bit of butter on the side. Okay. Here. Okay. And likewise, in that case, I'm dipping it in parsley rather than chive, but could be one or the other. It doesn't really matter. Here we are. My radish sandwich, that's it. The radish sandwich, the onion sandwich, great for lunch. Happy cooking."

You can see the inside of the pad here, and if you break it, there is a kind of flesh here, and it's quite sweet, actually. And, so we use that in a soup. Of course, you have to strain it. I strain it with a food mill because there is a lot of fiber in it. I have four cups water here, and it can be water, chicken stock or water. And I put about two teaspoons of chicken, chicken bouillon, chicken base here. I have a pound of potato here, a third of potatoes, so about four cups, you know, and my pound of peas. This is one pound of peas, and that pound of peas usually will give me about half of it, will be the peas, about seven, eight ounces, and the rest will be the part, same size, about the same amount. And, I'll put maybe some onion in there. Yeah. I think of onion. Maybe three quarter of a cup to a cup of onion. Okay. The salt, it depends on still need a little bit of salt, but it depends on your stock. We bring that to a very strong boil. I cover it and I cook it thirty minutes. Then we'll want to strain it, finish it up. Okay. Now it comes to a strong boil. I'm gonna cover it, lower the heat, and thirty minutes. As you can see, the pot are really green here. After thirty minutes, they'll turn slightly darker color. My pea soup is cooked, and as you can see now, the the product change color, and of course, they are very fibrous. So this, what I want to do first, I usually, I put that directly in the food processor, like this. You know, at least the pad. I think I have all of it here. Maybe a little bit of the liquid. I'll put that through the food mill here. Or if you don't have a food mill through a strainer, it's a little bit more work. See there, the food meal, this way you have your leg here that you do. Make sure that you put that the right way. I've been to people who put it this way. No, it goes this way. And I used to use that certainly a great deal before the advance of the food processor. You know, we use that all the time. Okay. Put half of it maybe. Come back up the other way, a few times this way. As you can see here, a lot of fiber. So clean up the bottom of the pan. Clean up of this. Okay, so I remove most of the fiber in there, with the rest of it. Rinse it with a little bit of the stock here. And I put now I can really just put it in there. Delicious taste of peas. Remember, I have no oil. I have no butter. I have nothing in it, so I'm gonna finish it with about a third of a cup of cream. And as you can see here, I have a close to one and a half quart of soup, and even with a third or even half a cup of cream. It's less than one tablespoon per person. So enough soup, I would say for six at least here. Nice portion of soup like that. The fish tastes wonderful. Maybe a little bit chaine for color on top, and this is it. My pea pot soup.

            "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. But I don't know what to do for dinner. I very often end up with eggs. I want to show you the engrais, a gratin of eggs, how to do it with a little bechamel, a cream sauce. So here, I need about a tablespoon, tablespoon of butter in there, and a tablespoon of flour. So this is what you call your roux. You know, when you add the flour and butter together. Usually, you mix it. And here I cook it, what time? Fifteen seconds, twenty, thirty seconds. That's it. And then a cup of milk. The milk is cold, as you can see. Dash of salt in there. Dash of pepper. And you want to bring that to a boil. That's a cream sauce. Occasionally you mix with your whisk. Make sure that you put the palm of your hand on top of it here to go into those corners here. Yeah. As soon as it comes to a boil, it's going to thicken. For that part, what we have here, I have eggs here. As you can see, that I slice. And those eggs are perfectly cooked. Totally yellow, no green around the yolk, and this is what you don't want. I have five eggs here. For two people, it would be a nice, a nice gratin. And I wanted to show you how to peel an egg. When that egg is lowered into boiling water nine, ten minutes at the bowl. As soon as it's cooked, take it out, pour out the boiling water and put ice cold water. Leave it in cold water until it's cold enough. This is important. This is what prevent that green tinge around the yolk because that green tinge is caused by that, by the sulfur in the egg. See, I break it all around there. And of course here, if I were in the sink, I would do that under running water to peel it. You see, because there is a second skin here. And when the water runs, it runs in between the skin and makes it easy to peel. So here, water. Okay. Here's my eggs. I have five eggs. I can any type of garnish that I want to put on top. Let's see that. That welcome to a bowl pretty good. So what I want to do, I have mushroom here. I am going to garnish. That actually, one mushroom, I think maybe end up. I'll put it in my sauce to bring it to a boil. Now it's boiling, as you can see here. And now I will put a little bit of cream in there, probably a quarter of a cup or so. And that's it. That's my cream sauce, very rich and delicious. So in the garnish of this, in that case here, I'm putting a few corn because I happen to have corn here. I'm putting about onethree of a cup of mozzarella cheese. You could do Swiss cheese, you could do that. And I have a little bit of ham here, two small slice of ham. That. I put also the garnish on top. I'm gonna put some cracked pepper on top of that. I think I'll need it more. I can do that ahead. If you do it ahead, you want to cook it in the oven, a regular oven, four hundred degrees, probably twenty minutes. If it's boiling hot when I put that on top, then I can do it under the broiler. Some chives. And of course, you can do the same idea with a gratin of cauliflower, a gratin of different type of vegetables. So here, move it a little bit to have some of the sauce going in between. Here we are here. Maybe a teaspoon or so of Parmesan cheese on top of it, ready to. And that's it. Now I'm going to put that under the broiler for a few minutes. Of course, we can prepare that ahead and put it in the when you're ready. Here is my gratin of eggs. Now three minutes under the broiler, makes a delightful dinner or lunch. Nothing like eggs.

Here, I have the the red beans, which is classic too. So I have half a pound of round beef here, and, four cup of water. I have a couple of slice of, bacon here. I'm going to cut into little pieces like this. And of course, you can cook beans in a in a pressure cooker. It goes faster. You can also soak them overnight. It helps a little bit in the cooking, but I like to start them cold like this. So I have half half a pound of beans I'm going to put here, which is a cup and a half. And what I'll do, I'll wash them a little bit, you know. You never know. One, one and a half cup, a set. Okay. So this is the beginning of my chili, and I'm gonna put in there one and a half teaspoon of salt. Make sure that if you start as I do there, you start them with cold water, not boiling water. It toughen them. Then I'll add one and a half teaspoon also of chili powder, about one and a half teaspoon, half a teaspoon coriander here, and half a teaspoon of cumin powder. Okay, this is about my mixture here. I will bring that to a boil and cook them gently covered for one and a half hours. And then the garnish you can prepare ahead. I have here, I like to put in there. Either tomato, or in that case, I'm putting red salsa. Red salsa now come in jar or fresh, like tomato. I have a little bit of celery here, about, probably threefour of a cup. And about probably a cup and a half of onion. One large onion, about ten ounces. I like to put that after an hour and a half. I think I get a fresher taste with the vegetable when they are not cooked for, like, three hours. I'm going to have about four or five cloves of garlic here. Those are big. I'm gonna cut them very coarsely. All right. I have some jalapeno pepper here. It's always you already have to taste it. The paper will blow your mind, and sometimes it tastes like green pepper. So So again, it's a question of taste, but I would say about three, three tablespoons, three to four tablespoons. And this, this is frozen. Each time that I buy cilantro, usually coriander cilantro. I cut the stem like that and put them in the freezer. And as you can see, those are frozen. I cut it frozen. It just crumbles into pieces, but that's a lot of taste. And it's my wife who show me how to put that into any type of bean beans dish. We put cilantro in there. So here, probably a quarter of a cup of cilantro stem frozen. So my chili has been cooking for an hour and a half now, as you can see, the beans, but the beans are still tough. I can see that. Now the rest of the garnish that we put in there. We bring that to a boil, and that will cook again, on low heat for another hour. Okay, finally, my chili is cooked. So an hour and a half. Then we put all the seasoning in it, and I cooked it another hour and a half. So it will depend on your beans. Sometime a little more, sometime a little less until they are tender. I serve it sometime in tortilla, of course, the classic way. Some of the time, I like to serve it into iceberg leaves like this. It's nice and crunchy. And of course, when you eat it, you have to grab it too and you make a mess, but it's okay. And on top of it, I like, strong cheddar cheese like this. Minced onion.

It takes a while to cook. I used to have a restaurant on Fifth Avenue in New York called La Potagerie. I used to do. That was one of the soaps who was featured there. Part of my wife background, Cuban and Puerto Ricans, what you do, I've done it already, you know, go through the bean this way to make sure that, there is no stone, I have done it here. I have another one. And, another one here or a damaged beans. And then what I do after that, I rinse them out. I rinse this out under water and now I have my pound of beans, two quart of water. I may add more water later on. One quart of chicken stock. Half a cup of rice. Sometimes I use brown rice. Half a teaspoon of cumin and of chili powder. And that, of course, you can always challenge that. You like it, you don't like it, you want another seasoning, it's fine. It's all a question of taste. And one teaspoon of salt, I probably will have more sauce later on. So that's it. As soon as it come to a good boil, cover it very low heat, an hour and a half, two hours. Well, I just check the black bean soup and frankly, the beans are practically cooked. So as you see, an hour and a half there. I have that big bunch of cilantro here, and I usually do take the top off. I keep that as a garnish. This very often I take it and I freeze it, you know, and I use it frozen. Yeah. But in that case, it's fresh. That's going to go in the soup now. Sometimes I put tomato, and you can put tomato is perfectly fine, a can of tomato. Here, I have a jar or a can or whatever of hot salsa, you know, medium. So you can have it. Sometimes it's very hot. Sometimes it's medium hot and all that. It will work, I have like six, five, six cloves of garlic here. I have a leek. Maybe a little too much, but I think I will have three cups here. How about three cups of leek? Couple of chop of onion. This will have to cook for another hour. I may add a little more liquid or not depending how thick it is, but certainly I need salt, half a teaspoon. Bring that to a boil. Again, slow it cook for an hour. Okay. Now the black bean soup is finally cooked and I think that it's too thick. I'm gonna put another couple of a cup, cup and a half, depending the way you like it, of a chicken stock or water, it'd be perfectly fine too. I have enough soup here for, like, twelve people. And usually what I do, I take a couple of tablespoon of this, a couple of cup of this in the food processor or blender, and put it back in there to kind of make it creamier and all that, of course, if you have that type of machine, I can do that in there. You know, just. Yeah, that's about it. Just to give a certain creaminess to it. As I said, I do that in container and I freeze it. You know, that's the best way to do it. But I wanna show you a couple of way that I serve it at my house, I can see it's quite thick. I'm gonna do cilantro into it. By the way, my wife loves it. It's with a banana, I guess, in the style of Cuba, I guess. Now if you do banana head, you can slice your banana head. Make sure you put that with a little tablespoon of lemon juice or something like that so that, so here, have some banana. One for me. Well, I could put a little bit of onion. Those are Vidalia type of onion, very mild. But even though when I do a lot of onion ahead like this, I rinse it under water so it prevents it from discoloring and it will stay white now. This one here, a garnish of eggs is good too. I cut the eggs one way, then you go back the other way, and that makes a perfect egg salad, you know, when you cut it both way, this way. So I will have the garnish of eggs. In my restaurant in New York at La Potangerie, I think we serve it with a garnish of egg. Always, I serve it probably with a few drops of Tabasco on top, or you can let your guests do it. And even sometime a dash of a bit of olive oil on top like this to give a glaze, you know? And sometimes even a dash of vinegar, sometimes people like a bit of acidity there. Oh, this one, I live this way. And there is, for my wife, my homemade, black bean soup with two interpretation of it. I hope you're going to enjoy it. Happy cooking."

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. You know, one of the thing that I do often when I have leftover egg white, and if I know my granddaughter is coming, eat meringue, I can do them, put them in a plastic box in the the pantry, and they can stay there for wicks, you know. I have four egg white here and four egg white, it's standard. As you see, when I don't have that much here, four, the whisk barely touch it. So what I do, I open this and let it fall. That give me that much more so I know it touch the bottom of the pan. And that is gonna be for a few minutes until it gets nice and really foamy and holding, and then I put the sugar. Now you can see. I can't stop it to show you how it hold a nice shaved. So now I put the sugar in it, and I put the sugar relatively fast. One cup of sugar. Okay. That's it. My mother never used a pastry bag, but I'll show you to you the pastry bag, especially now we have them in the in plastic like this. So to come back, usually you turn this upside down so that you clean up the side of your bowl. I have one here, a standard one, which is just straight. Theoretically, what you do too, you push that in like this so that you know it's not going to come out. And if you have something high like this or above, you put that in. That helps you to put your mixture in there. So here, I have my meringue. I mean, theoretically what you do, you hold it underneath here. Like that, you can clean up. Okay. You're boring. I'll show you some of it with that, see here, you clean up. You bring that back here so this thing is nice and clean. At the end, you fold that like an accordion like this, and you bring it here, and then you press with that part of the hand, never opening this. Now you can extend this, you know, bring it, and as you bring it, you turn it. So here I have it this way. I can do that type of thing, you know, like a drop, this, or a regular meringue this way. You can use a a fluted one. But at that point, I will put this way. And as you can see here, I have I have four egg white and quite a lot of meringue with those. Okay. Now, of course, my mother, as I said, never use a pastry bag and it's perfectly fine. You use them just like this. Use a big and in fact, it has a different look. Here. Another one here. Actually, even have some leftover, so I'll put it on top of this. So that goes into the oven. Very often people cook it at a very low temperature. So some people say the meringue should stay very white. I don't agree with that. I cook it at two twenty five, which is a bit higher, and my meringue will be slightly beige in color, but at very naughty taste. So here it goes for about close to three hours. And that's it. My meringue are cooked very, very light. You know, you can see that. Slightly beige, I like them that color, very crunchy. This is the best meringue this way. You can present them this way, serve them with a bit of whipped cream, can even some thyme. We put some jam in there, a little bit of jam or chocolate, very often chocolate, we glue two meringue together like this that you serve maybe with a little bit of whipped cream or whatever, that's a classic dessert. Otherwise, I put them in one of those containers here, and this is it. They have to be tightly covered and they'll stay there for weeks, months, you know, so without any problem if they are tightly covered like this. And this is how you make meringue. I create dessert for very little money. Hope you enjoy it. Happy cooking."

I'm gonna show you today how to make a little stew of chicken with yam, a boiled onion, those are frozen pearl onion, and mushroom and a bit of wine too. So I have a tablespoon of oil here and a tablespoon of butter to start browning the chicken. And that chicken, what I did here, I'm going to take the skin out of it. So, you know, you can buy, this is the chicken leg, of course. You go to the end like this. Very often, I keep that skin actually to do, to saute or do things render the fat too. It's quite good. I keep the skin usually and I separate the drumstick and the thigh here. I keep the skin usually if I brown a chicken and then the skin will be crusty. But in that case, I'm going to brown the chicken, but then I add liquid after. So if you have the skin at that point, the liquid, the whole skin become kind of gooey and, and soft, and it render all the fat, so there is no advantage to it. So here We have the two legs. Okay. Salt. And that will brown probably for eight, ten minutes. And during that time, I'm going to prepare my vegetable. I have two cloves some garlic here. Coarsely that are going to go into it soon. I have a bit of onion here, coarsely chopped again. And finally, I have that yam here that I'm going to, peel I'm cutting pieces. I've done that with yellow turnips, as well, or regular potato. I like to peel it. Some people don't, and I guess it's okay. That's good. One, two, three. Maybe five five pieces here. And let's see now, these have been cooking like a minute or so. See, starting to brown nicely. I want them to brown ball in that. On both sides. So another couple of minutes. Okay. My chicken is nicely browned. Now I see crystallization. I have about half a cup of onion here and two cloves of garlic, like crushed. You can see the bottom of the pan here is very important. The crystallization. It's nice and brown here. So when we deglaze, it's going to give a very good juice. So then the rest will go in. I'm gonna put half a cup of white wine here. Maybe a couple of tablespoons of water. That's it. And then my mushroom, sweet potato. That's it. Onion. About a dozen of those girly onion. I mean, because this is, well, you can serve that for two a whole egg, or for four, half an egg per person. We tend to serve small portion. We're gonna come and now come to a boil. Leave it on high heat, come to a boil, lower the heat, so two twenty five minutes, and this is it. It's ready to be served. Okay. Thirty minutes. See that my chicken is cooked. The sweet potato, very cooked too. This is it. This, of course, is good reheated so you don't have to prepare it and eat it right away. But, you know, here I'm serving that family style here. One more of those. All that wonderful juice, mushroom. Of course, maybe a bit of parsley leaves. A beautiful dish of chicken and yam.

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. So what I'm doing today is a chicken in vegetable and cream sauce. Yesterday, I had a Cornish ham that I roasted all like this, and my wife and I tend to like the left more. So we add the leg and the wing. So I have those Two breasts here, and I'm going to do just like a chicken pot pie except they I'm not going to put the dough on top of it. So we started with the carrot. The carrot should cook first for, like, two, three minute. I have a piece of onion here that will go into it. Also, we used to do that at Howard Johnson. I remember I would have tiny boiled onion, but I don't have it, so I'd onion this way. I have one mushroom that I find in my refrigerator that I'm going to use it too. Here. Yeah. Okay. So that's all of the garnish. And I have some frozen peas here, defrosting. I will Thicken the sauce here with a little bit of con potato starch, actually. But those shall see better than cornstarch. Cornstarch tend to be too gooey. Conventionally, you melt butter. You add flour to it, and you do a roux to do the stock. Here, I'm going in a simpler way. One teaspoon of that starch here and about a tablespoon of water With, yeah. That's it. That will be enough to thicken this. Now my carrot have been cooked. So let me add this. You could, if you wanted, use chicken stock instead of water. I'll put a little bit of, you know, chicken paste here to make a stock. I have salt in there. This is ready. This so my chicken Here, I'm gonna take the skin out of it. The bone. Yeah. We turned at the house to use The dark meat, we like better. This is not a leftover dish. The word leftover often has bad connotation. We will say it's leftover. No. Often because you have that type of chicken, if you want to reheat it to serve it the same way you did it before, it probably won't work, won't be as good. But if you do something else with it, As I said, Howard Johnson, we used to cook the breast of chicken and, add them to the sauce. So here, I put that into large Pieces like this. Okay. Here, here, here. I think I'm going to add the peas in there. And probably my remember, I had a cup of water, But that cup of water, by the time it boils for a couple of minutes now, it's probably reduced to, like, three quarter of a cup. Let me see the carrot. Nice and crunchy, but cooked enough. So I have the starch is already diluted with water or any type of liquid, wine or whatever. And the beauty of that potato sauce, it thickens on contact. As soon as I put it in there, it thickens. We know exactly where you stand. So you could have more than that. You pour whatever you want and stir it and see how thick it gets. Stir the rest of it. A quarter of a cup of, cream here, maybe not even, like, three tablespoon. And that's what I'm going to do for my cream sauce. As we can see here, beautiful cream sauce. My chicken, bring that to a boil in there. I'm going to put some pepper here. Dash of salt. And basically, that's it. I warm up my chicken, And I have it there. You know, the interesting part is that we will say, oh my god, that cream is rich. Actually, no. I'm not going to tell you that it's a low calorie dish, but I have no butter. I have no oil. One tablespoon of oil is one hundred and thirty calories. I add like three or four tablespoons of cream here, Fifty calorie ish, so it's two hundred calorie. The rest is water, carrot, the thing so it may be three hundred calorie At the most, for two people, so it's about the the the the amount of what you have with two cookie. So this is it. And as you can see here, I have two portions here. You can have a little bit of rice with it or whatever. Beautiful dish done with leftover, but it is not leftover food. This is the chicken and cream And vegetable. Happy cooking."

            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I wanna show you something slightly different today. Delicious and very, very inexpensive. People don't do it very often. Kidney. This is pork kidney. In France, usually, we do more lamb kidney as well as, veal kidney, some type beef kidney. I learned how to do the pork kidney with my wife, and, she loves it, and I do too now. Maybe the best of all. So the first thing that you do, you have to clean them up. There is that layer of, of, sinew in the center of it. Usually, we cut it in half and remove it. I find a better way of doing it. I go directly in the center up to the skin. I can feel it here and flat mine. I put my nail plate on top of it like this. Again, here would be the same thing here. And now you see I have all of this in the center. I turn it the other way to do it this, And finally, this one here. So I have that old sinew from the center has been removed and it's totally clean. So this is one kidney. This one is very large. This one, as you can see, slightly smaller, and it's fine. And this will cook very fast. Minute, minute and a half on each side. It should be slightly pink in the center. Otherwise, it get toast. So here we are. I'm gonna put some salt and pepper on top of this. And here, a good tablespoon or two of olive oil, and I want it really quite hot. I can start one like this. It's very hot. Okay. One, two, three. Minutes and a half of butter on this side. That's it. This way. Mini torto on the other side, full blast. In a professional kitchen, my stove would be twice as hard as this. It doesn't what we do. And then with this, a little bit of onion. Oh, maybe a little more to have. Okay. Now this is cooked enough. Put it there. Tube. Okay, here, the onion. And I wanna put a bit of garlic with that. Very garlic. We'll go with this. Could use a dash more of oil in there to fry that, onion, and then I will deglaze that with a little bit of white wine. Two, three tablespoons. Reduce it just a minute or so. And then I'm putting My secret ingredient here, a little bit of V eight, like a third of a cup at the most, and I like the spicy yeast. And we let it reduce in a professional kitchen, see what you have. You open, you have some tomato sauce ready, you have some goosene, you have brown stock, you have white stock, you have all of it, and you can add a little bit of all of that when you create sauce. So here's a little bit of the same idea. I'm trying to use my refrigerator. So here is Let me taste this. A dash of salt. That's good. And that's about it. See, what I wanted to show you is that the juice is coming out. It should be pink like this, beautiful juice, and very often we add add juice to it. Okay. Bit of green on top of it, my parsley, and this is it. A dish which is done at the last moment, very fast, delicious, very inexpensive, and great to eat.

        "transcription": [
            "Hi, I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. I want to show you how to cook string beans, haricots ver in France. We refer usually to the haricots ver to the very tiny one. Those are okay. They could be finer than that for the haricot vert. When I was a kid, you know, you had to take the haricot vert here, and this is the end which is hanging to the plant. We would cut this one and that one. Like the end, the long one here, we would cut it this way and run it and you will have a string right up. We get to the end, we break it on the other side, and you'll have another string on the other side. String means don't have any drink anymore. You still have to remove at least that piece. By habit, I still remove the other piece as well. But in any case, I I remember years ago, we cooked that a long time. Then we cook it less and less and less to the point that now people call blanched it. That is put it in boiling water for a few seconds, remove it. That's not enough for me. So water, a good amount of salt in the water. Put your string beans. We used to do that in large baths in professional kitchens, which were in copper, and the copper itself tends to keep them green. But of course, it's not done anymore. I have enough water here. Theoretically, also, you're told not to cover it, but I cover it and the only reason is that it come back faster to a boil. Otherwise, it takes too long. Coming back to a boil, and we will boil it for a few minutes and taste it. For the time being, that string beans is raw, as you can see. And if I go like this, it break. Textures change how it goes along. We're gonna saute that with some shallots. I have the shallots here. Shallots, of of course, is a is a type of onion, yeah, and, you peel it on each side. It's classic to have the string beans sauteed with, with shallot, of course. But first, you cook your string beans. You cool your string beans. You cool your string beans. When you're ready, you start sauteing it. So here I have a shallot, which is cut in half. To cut that shallot. Again, I will use my finger. Notice that I put them flat, so it's easier when it's round. And here, I would go this way. Cut through. So this is the it's all cut here, as you can see, but still attached to the end. So I go on the side here, cut a little bit this way. Again, this way, maybe twice. And again, the same idea here. This is finely chopped shallot. Finely chopped shallot, finely sliced Shallot. So here it, this is usually the two way those shallots are used, sometimes whole also. You have the chopped shallot, sliced shallot. And for the string meat, you can use one or the other. Now as you can see, it's boiling, so you can uncover it if you want. It's about two minutes now, and a lot of people will remove it at that point. And at that point, yeah, it banned all that. But for me, No. It depends also, of course, on the side of your haricot vert, your string beans sometimes are very, very thin, very fresh out of the garden, all of that change. But you're at three minutes now and from Viet will knead with that side stirring meat, at least another couple of minutes. I don't like them mushy, like them slightly firm, crunchy under my tip, but with the taste of spring beans. When they are undercooked like that, to me, they don't really have the taste of bring beans. Another thing too, as we used to do very large quantity of it, as soon as they are cooked, we would transfer them to ice water to stop the cooking, and it's fine, especially in a professional kitchen when you do three, four, five pounds at a time. I have half a pound of string beans here. How to, and at home, what I would do, I would drain the water out and keep them here so that they dry out because of the hotness, they dry out very easily. And then right away, I take a skillet, a little bit of butter, and I saute them in there. So I think my string mitts now are about six minutes. If I see the small one here, The small one is perfect now. Just slightly crunchy. To at that point here, I would put them under cold water, of course, to cool them up, but just to show it to you. I could actually continue cooking in there in there if I need it right away. It would be fine. But if I don't need right away, I may refresh them a little bit so that and then leave them here ready to be sauteed. And as you can see, they are beautifully green. To saute the string beans, I will use a skillet, like a tablespoon of butter, and always I put a little dash of oil. That prevents the butter from burning also. You want to saute that. Pour different taste in your spring beans. You could let the butter cook enough so it becomes slightly hazelnut in color, slightly brown. It will have a different taste. I have the chopped shallots here. And actually, I'm gonna put a bit of slice shallots too. So this, remember the shallots are roe, this is cooked. To let that cook for thirty, forty seconds on high heat. So even though I add salt in the water, still need a little bit of sauce here. So here it goes. This is cooked enough now. And put that in there. And of course, mine are still hot, but otherwise, I would let them. Dash of salt put the pepper. Alright. This is a classic garnish a rack of lamb or a steak, and here we are, string bits with shallots. Ricover Hosea shallot. Perfectly cooked."

And now, of course, I buy mayonnaise all the time to use it, but it's nice to know how to do it. Sometimes different flavor and all that. I want to show you how to do it. And here I have one egg. Break it flat like this, open it. This is one of the best way to remove the yolk, to do it like this to make sure that you really separate all of it, including even that piece called the shallots at the end. So I have one egg yolk. I'm going to have about a tablespoon of mustard here, a dash of salt, and pepper. The secret of mayonnaise very often is the temperature of the ingredient. Your oil particularly cannot be cold, ice cold, Otherwise, it's going to break down. And then I'm going to put two teaspoons of vinegar. So this is the base of my mayonnaise that I mix here. Okay. Some time, you can put a a towel like this around so that your bowl is more secure. And then I would have about a couple and a half of, of oil in there. So here I have Peanut oil. This is where it comes to be your own taste. Peanut oil, olive oil, you know. And maybe even in that case, I'm gonna put maybe a tablespoon or so of of sesame oil. I could put hazelnut oil or whatever. So to start with, you go slowly. I mean, sometimes, everything will they tell you drop by drop. It's not really drop by drop. I mean, I'm going to you can see here, it won't take more than a minute, minute and a half to do the whole thing. So here, you can as you go along, you go a bit faster with the oil, and that's it. So here, probably didn't take me more than A minute and a half, two minutes at the most to do a wonderful bowl of mayonnaise, which now you can flavor Different twist, tartar, green beige, all of those are different type of dough that you serve with your mayonnaise. I want to test it. Seasoned egg is fine, and it's not too strong. See, that's the point. Now here, very often, I like to present it in a nice way, this way. Present your mayonnaise here. Leave it like that, it looks beautiful. Or you can get the the top smooth with a knife or a spatula. And then after move your knife up and up and down in a jigsaw fashion A little bit up to here and that you pick that up to put that in the middle, or maybe a little sprig of parsley or thyme in the center. And this is fresh homemade mayonnaise. Happy cooking."

    "How to Open Clams & Oysters \uff5c Jacques P\u00e9pin Cooking At Home \uff5c KQED.f140.json": {
        "transcription": [
            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. Today, I I wanted to show you how to open clam and oyster. It's not an easy thing to do, and you have to be careful. And there is many implements that I have here. This one is classic. This one is classic also for the clam. This is a more sturdy one, and that the one I like really is this one. And I remember being with Julia, and she said, if you don't have anything else, use the can opener like this to open it. And it does work, but it's pretty hard to open it. And finally, for the for the clam, I like to use a little, pairing knife like this. Let's start with the clam. And what you do, actually, I use a small knife like that. I put it against the opening. I can feed it here. I go and I close right in. And I don't finish opening it. If I have two dozen to open, I open two dozen just this way. First and as you see this one, the thing broke, but still there. If this one is harder like this, then I take a towel, and you use it in the back in the hinge here to put in the and break it up and here. Okay. What I like to do is to open all of them this way. And what I didn't tell you, first, I put those in the freezer. They've been in the freezer ten minutes, ten, fifteen minutes, whatever. Just enough so that it shock them and it's easier to open. When they're all open and I can do that two, three hours ahead, and at the last time when I'm ready to serve them, I'm ready to open them. And and for that, very often, after I have a knife, I use a small spoon like that, which is pretty thin edge. So in order to, you know, clean just think like that and like that, there is no danger of cutting yourself. And again, here, this way and this way, you want to get that loose to have it here. And as you can see, this one here, I opened from the back, so it's slightly different. But again, I clean up the inside. Okay. Now the oysters. It's probably a little harder to open. And as I said, my favorite one is this one. So here, you would go in the hinge in the back here. So apply pressure. Make sure that you take a thirty tau. You want to go there and just pop it, and I heard it pop here. So again, each of them, I do this. I do one or two dozen at the time, and when I'm ready to open them so here, those are all in a sense being open. The half part is done here. So then again, I use my little knife. Somewhere now, there is a hole here. I can slide it in. And what you wanna cut is right there. You know, the nerve that you have here. And make it loose here the same way. Here. And the second one here. Nice and briny. Six oyster. Now if you cannot really open it like this, you try with a plier like that. Better a flatter one in front so that you break a little piece of the the shell here. And if you can break a little piece of the shell and have a little bit of a hole here, then you can put your knife. And toigneron and the knife, so you don't really waste that, that oyster. Another thing that I have done also, I have put the oyster in the microwave oven for about fifteen, twenty seconds. You get it loose, and you can open it this way. So here is my oyster and my clam. And now the sauce that we do most of the time, we use the most, is the very classic horseradish sauce. So here, let's say I have a quarter of a cup at the most of ketchup. I put a little bit of the hot sauce, maybe up a teaspoon at the most. What you wanna do here is put a little bit of, lemon juice. Or if you don't have it, very often I use this is a very mild vinegar. You know, again, maybe a teaspoon at the most. And the horseradish here, you can have some fresh one. I will have a good tablespoon of horseradish with this, and I have a very good sauce here. This is usually the classic one that we use at home all the time. Now for the oyster and also for the clams, we do sometime what we call a mignonette sauce. Mignonette refer to actually black pepper. See, this is black pepper. And when you break that black pepper, you crack it. And usually, I use a skillet like this. Move forward like that, cracking it. So this cracked paper is what we call mignonette. This is what you do when you do a steak au pois, for example. You fry it out. You dip your steak in it. Add the mignonette. I put in there. And shallots. I'm going to cut finally, maybe a good tablespoon of, shallots here, a couple of pieces of chives, especially if I have chives in my garden, so I use them all the time. You have usually a little dash of salt on top of it, and you fill it up with the best possible red wine vinegar that you have. Okay. So this is your mignonette sauce. Each one of that that you're going to do up in there to put on top of your oyster. And very often, at the table, you'll serve with a spoon like this. We have spoon and an indentation like this so that you can go with the the abducting muscle is. But as you see, I cut it. Delicious. With black bread and butter, that what goes well with it. Thank you. Happy cooking."

        "transcription": [
            "Hi. I'm Jacques Pepin, and I'm cooking at home. One of my wife's favorite dish is pork and beans served with rice. Of course, that's her Puerto Rican Quebec background. I wanted to show you how to cook it today using the pressure cooker. Pressure cooker are very safe now and easy to do, and it will take close to three hours for for those been to cook, there it will be an hour. You put it on top and the gauge here will go up with the when the pressure goes up And when you see those red lines, the pressure is on, then you can put it on very, very low. One hour, it will be cooked. So I put everything in there. So what I have here is half a pound of beans. I just washed it, and those are red beans. A three cup of water, cold water from the tap, a teaspoon and a half of salt, half a cup of tomato, with threefour of chopped tomato. Then I have baby rib here without the ribs. Sometimes they come without the ribs, sometimes with the rib, as you can see, those are cut here. And those are the back ribs. They are tender. And I have a pound and a half here to render for like three, four people. Okay. I have about four or five cloves of garlic here that I'm going to do very coarsely like this. Okay, put my garlic in there. I have a large onion here, about two cups of coarsely, or diced rather, inch diced onion doesn't really matter. So a lot of seasoning in there. I have a leek here, and again, put that leek in. This is less Puerto Rican and more French with the leek. So all of that goes in there. I'm gonna put a teaspoon of Italian seasoning here, half a teaspoon of cumin powder, and some frozen cilantro stem. When I buy cilantro, I cut the stem and freeze them. Keep that in the freezer. And on dishes like this, the stem give a wonderful flavor. Well, you have a bunch, and that's probably close to a quarter of a cup. I have two carrots, maybe one cup of carrot peeled. And finally, I'm gonna put some jalapeno in there, about a couple of tablespoons. Remember that in those hot peppers, the seed and the rib are the strongest. So sometimes you put some, sometimes you don't. You should taste it anyway because most of the time This one is pretty, pretty hot, but sometimes they are not. So here I have the whole mixture, and we'll serve that with rice. This will come to a boil. Close it. Up, it close, and we'll wait until the pressure goes off. And after that, one hour. One cup of rice. Carolina regular rice. Some people wash the rice, some don't. I don't really. Two cup water, one cup of rice, two cup of water. It's always one to two. And a quarter of a teaspoon of salt, and that's all there is to it. I bring that to a boil uncovered. Stir it a couple of times so it doesn't stick. Okay. You can see that my rice has come to a boil now. I stir it one last time. Cover it and on very, very low, as low as you can. At the same time, you can see that the pressure cooker here is getting to the red line with a couple of red line here, and this is it. So now again, I will put that on very low, one hour. Now what you wanna do is to decompress to decompress your pressure cooker on top here. And you can see the thing is, You got it fresh on there? I see a little more. It doesn't let you open it really until all the air is out, all the pressure is out. You know, depending how old your beans are, sometimes they are two years, three years old, you have to test it. This, I end up cooking almost an hour and a quarter. After an hour, it was not quite cooked enough. So you have to taste it. And I cook it sometime forty five minutes is enough. So here it is. The pork and beans. We have the rice here. Remember, the rice was cooked just with water. What you have to do when it finished cooking like this, like now, you have to floss it. And this is it. Rice and beans. The way royale, I love it. A bit of rice next to it. Maybe a bit of cilantro on top, couple of pieces, maybe a little dash of Tabasco. And this is it. Pork and beans with rice.
